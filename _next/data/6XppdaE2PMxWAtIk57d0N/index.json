This doubt and concern will be the focus of *Meditation* 1.\n\nBut Descartes is not only critic. He does not just want to cast doubt; he wants to also find a **new foundation** for certainty. So we will want to observe his method in *Meditations* 2 and 3 for how he thinks he can find certainty after doubting everything he previously held to be true. \n\nWe will also want to observe the pros and cons of this method. What kinds of things might it give us certainty about? Are there limitations to how far this certainty extends?\n\nWith that in mind, below are some guided reading questions to help us navigate *Meditation* 1.\n\n<QuestionBlock type=\"reading-content\">\n  <Question level={1}>Focus first on paragraph 1.</Question>\n  <Question level={2}>What is problem does Descartes thinks he is facing?</Question>\n  <Question level={2}>What is he searching for that he thinks will help him resolve this problem?</Question>\n</QuestionBlock>\n\n<QuestionBlock type=\"reading-content\">\n  <Question level={1}>Focus now on paragraph 2.</Question>\n  <Question level={2}>Does Descartes think he needs to prove every one of his beliefs false?
