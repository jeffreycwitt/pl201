But as this enterprise appeared to me to be one of great magnitude, I waited until I had\nattained an age so mature as to leave me no hope that at any stage of life more advanced I should\nbe better able to execute my design. On this account, I have delayed so long that I should\nhenceforth consider I was doing wrong were I still to consume in deliberation any of the time that\nnow remains for action.
