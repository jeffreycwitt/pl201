(For a review of inductive knowledge, see Posterior Analytics, Book II, c. 19.)\n  * How might induction still be an example of Aristotle's assertion that \"all learning requires previous cognition\"?\n  * In what way is this an alternative to Plato's theory of recollection?","data":{"title":"Class 12 Guided Reading Questions","description":"Exam Review Questions"},"filePath":"class-12.mdx"},{"content":"\n<QuestionBlock type=\"reading-content\">\n<Question level={1}>How do fragments 1 and 2 paint different portraits of the first philosopher?</Question>\n<Question level={2}>What seems to be Thales’ primary field of study?</Question>\n<Question level={2}>Why does Thales appear foolish and impractical in the first fragment?</Question>\n<Question level={2}>According to the second fragment, why isn't Thales a rich businessman?</Question>\n</QuestionBlock>\n\n<QuestionBlock type=\"reading-content\">\n<Question level={1}>According to fragment 5, why do the early philosophers (including Thales) think that matter is the underlying principle of the world?</Question>\n<Question level={2} type=\"reading-discussion\">When the fragment discusses \"principles,\" what do you think it means?</Question>\n<Question level={2}>What kind of specific matter does Thales take to be the underlying principle of the world?
