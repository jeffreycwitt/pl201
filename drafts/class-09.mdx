# Some Background

We're going to turn a text today called *Meditations on First Philosophy* by Rene Descartes. 

This text was first written in 1641 (so many years after Plato and Aristotle) and it is our first introduction to some more modern philosophers. 

But the reason we're going to focus on this text (apart from it being a classic), is that it's going to ask us to look  closely at the process of induction. 

Specifically, it is going to pose some questions about the level of certainty that can be generated from the kind of inductive reasoning described by Aristotle (e.g. start from sense observations, then move to memory, then experience, and finally develop a general principle or definition).

Descartes is going to raise some serious doubts about whether certainty can be achieved in this way. This doubt and conern will be the focus of Meditation 1, our reading for today.

But Descartes is not only critic. He does not just want to cast doubt, he wants to also find a **new foundation** for certainty. So we will want to observe his method, especially in *Meditations* 2 and 3 for how he thinks he can find certainty. But we will also want to observe the pros and cons of this method. What kinds of things might it give us certainty about? Are there limitations to how far this certainty extends.

With that in mind, below are some guided reading questions to help us navigate *Meditation* 1.
