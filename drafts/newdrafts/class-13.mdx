## A Question for Thales

Thales wanted to find a single cause or explanation for the universe. 
In pursuit of such an explanation he proposed that the entire universe 
is fundamentally made up of one element: water

But if everything is water, how is Thales to account for our "lived experience" of variety and difference. Maybe everything is water. But why doesn't it all look like water?
 
If you think about it, this is still a question today that needs explaining. 

I can point to an ice cube and you can tell me it is water. 
But then I can point to a glass of water and you will tell me it is also water. 
Again, I can point to a cloud in the sky and again you will tell me it is also water.

## Anaximenes on Condensation and Rarefaction 

Anaximenes took the above question seriously. 

If we're going to be able to explain the world in terms of a single cause (where this cause is some singular "stuff"), then the burden is on us to explain how this stuff can appear so "qualitatively different".

In the scene below, there are three qualitatively different objects (perhaps one is "hard" and one is "somewhat firm" and the third is "very soft"). Let us imagine that each is composed of "air" (imagined as cubes), which Anaximenes proposed as an alternative to water. 

Explore the three objects below. (Zoom in and out, rotate around and inspect each object.) The consider the questions below.

<QuestionBlock type="reading-discussion">
<Question>Since each object is made of air (cubes), and in this case the same amount of cubes, what is left to explain our different experience of these three objects?</Question>
</QuestionBlock>

<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">
<Question level={1}>How does Anaximenes use the concept of condensation and rarefaction to explain our different experience of these objects?</Question>
</QuestionBlock>

<QuestionBlock type="reading-discussion">
<Question level={1}>Compare fragments 12 and 21. How can Anaximenes be seen as trying to add more precision to the account of change and variation already given by Anaximander?</Question>
</QuestionBlock>

<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">
<Question level={1}>According to fragment 24, why does "Air" always need to be moving?</Question>
</QuestionBlock>

<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">
<Question level={1}>In fragments, 26 and 28, how is "Air" used to explain the creation of the earth and the planets and the stars?</Question>
</QuestionBlock>

<QuestionBlock type="reading-discussion">
<Question level={1}>In terms of explaining the world as we know it, with all its variety, why might Anaximander's focus on the principle of the world as "moving" and "directive of other things" be seen as an advance over Thales's explanation of the world in terms of water alone? </Question>
<Question level={2}>What does it begin to account for that Thales's theory did not seem to address?  (Consider especially the introduction to this section and fragments 9, 11, and 12.)</Question>
