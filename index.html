(For a review of inductive knowledge, see Posterior Analytics, Book II, c. 19.)\n  * How might induction still be an example of Aristotle's assertion that \"all learning requires previous cognition\"?\n  * In what way is this an alternative to Plato's theory of recollection?","data":{"title":"Class 12 Guided Reading Questions","description":"Exam Review Questions"},"filePath":"class-12.mdx"},{"content":"\n\u003cQuestionBlock type=\"reading-content\"\u003e\n\u003cQuestion level={1}\u003eHow do fragments 1 and 2 paint different portraits of the first philosopher?\u003c/Question\u003e\n\u003cQuestion level={2}\u003eWhat seems to be Thales’ primary field of study?\u003c/Question\u003e\n\u003cQuestion level={2}\u003eWhy does Thales appear foolish and impractical in the first fragment?\u003c/Question\u003e\n\u003cQuestion level={2}\u003eAccording to the second fragment, why isn't Thales a rich businessman?\u003c/Question\u003e\n\u003c/QuestionBlock\u003e\n\n\u003cQuestionBlock type=\"reading-content\"\u003e\n\u003cQuestion level={1}\u003eAccording to fragment 5, why do the early philosophers (including Thales) think that matter is the underlying principle of the world?\u003c/Question\u003e\n\u003cQuestion level={2} type=\"reading-discussion\"\u003eWhen the fragment discusses \"principles,\" what do you think it means?\u003c/Question\u003e\n\u003cQuestion level={2}\u003eWhat kind of specific matter does Thales take to be the underlying principle of the world?
