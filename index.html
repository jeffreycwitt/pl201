Describe what you \"see\" when you do this\u003c/Question\u003e\n\u003c/QuestionBlock\u003e\n\nParmenides claims it can't be done. If you're thing of \"anything\", then you are still thinking of \"something\". \n\nThus, if you claim to be successfully thinking of \"nothing\", then you are actually still thinking of \"something\".\n\nFor Parmenides, \"nothing\" is completely unintelligible.\n\nThis might seem like a small claim, but Parmenides draws out some big implications from the unintelligibility of nothingness.\n\nThe most important implication is what it means for one of our most common experiences, namely our experience of change.\n\nIn direct opposition to Heraclitus, Parmenides asserts that change is actually not happening and cannot happen. Despite what your senses tell you, nothing changes.\n\nWhy is Parmenides so confident? \n\nHe gives us a version of the following argument.\n\n1) First, if something comes to be from \"already being\", then it already is, and therefore it did not actually come to be. \n\nConsider P. 60, fragment 8, line 18-20)\n\n2) Second, if something comes to be from \"non-being\", then it comes from nothing. (But nothing, if it is really nothing, can't become something because it would first have to be something. Parmenides' view is often captured in the phrase \"nothing comes from nothing\".)\n\nConsider what he says on p. 59, fragment 8, line 6: \n\n\u003e \"For what birth will you seek out for it? How and from what did it grow? For what is not I will allow you neither to say nor to think…\"\n\nWe could formalize this argument even more: \n\n1)\tIf E (Exists), then A (Already exists) (p. 60, fragment 8, line 18-20)\n2)\tIf ~E (Not Exists), then N (nothing, because nothing comes from nothing) (p. 59, frag. 8, line 5-17)\n3)\tThings either E (exists) or ~E (do not exists)\nC)  Therefore, Everything A (Already exists) or N (is Nothing).\n\n\u003cQuestionBlock type=\"reading-discussion\"\u003e\n  \u003cQuestion level={1}\u003eDoes this argument remind you of anything we've seen before? \u003c/Question\u003e\n  \u003cQuestion level={2}\u003eWhy do you think the arguments are so similar?\u003c/Question\u003e\n\u003c/QuestionBlock\u003e\n\nThe result is that there is only one thing in the universe, it is the \"What is\" and it never changes in any way.\n\n## Other Descriptions of the \"What is\"\n\nLet's consider more closely what this \"What is\" or \"Being\" is that Parmenides says never goes in or out of existence. \n\nHere you might consider closely Fragment 8, line 23 and following. I'll focus on four key characteristics below.\n\n### 1. It is necessarily one, unified, and indivisible\n\n\u003cQuestionBlock type=\"reading-discussion\"\u003e\n  \u003cQuestion level={1}\u003eWhy can't the \"What is\" be divided?\u003c/Question\u003e\n\u003c/QuestionBlock\u003e\n\nFredrick Copelston explains as follows:  \n\n\u003e \"Because if it is not one but divided, then it must be divided by something other than itself. But Being cannot be divided by something other than itself, for besides being there is nothing.\"\n\nConsider the following example. \n\nImagine I have a line. \n\n\u003chr/\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\nAnd then I want to cut this line into distinct parts, so I break it up, like so: \n\n-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-\n\nIf the horizontal line represents the \"what is\", and the \"what is\" is the only thing in the world that exists, what are the vertical lines in the above illustration? \n\nAccording to Paremenides, they can only be more of the \"what is\". Thus, the division is only an illusion. It is actually impossible to break up the line or divide it because whatever you try to use to separate or divide the line will just be more of the line itself.\n\n### 2. It is complete - nothing can be added to it.\n\n\u003cQuestionBlock type=\"reading-discussion\"\u003e\n  \u003cQuestion level={1}\u003eWhy might it seem like a problem if something could be \"added\" to the \"What is\"?\u003c/Question\u003e\n\u003c/QuestionBlock\u003e\n\nConsider Fragment 8.24: \n\n\u003e \"And not all more in any way, which would keep it from holding together or at all less, but it is full of what-is…\"\n\nAgain Copelston states \"…anything that was added to 'being', would itself be MORE being\" (and thus would already be a part of being).\n\n### 3. It is immovable, unchanging, and continuous\n\nConsider Fragment 8:25: \n\n\u003e \"But unchanging in the limits of great bonds it is without starting or ceasing…\"\n\n\u003cQuestionBlock type=\"reading-discussion\"\u003e\n  \u003cQuestion level={1}\u003eWhy can't the \"What is\" move?\u003c/Question\u003e\n\u003c/QuestionBlock\u003e\n\nYou might consider, to where it would it move. If it tries to move to another place, what will already be there before it gets there? Won't the \"What is\" simply find that it was always already there.\n\n### 4. It is necessary and eternal.\n\nThe \"What is\" can never have first moment in which it begins to be. Nor can it every cease to be.\n\nConsider Fragment 8.30:\n\n\u003e \"Remaining the same and in the same and by itself it lies and so remains there fixed; for mighty necessity holds it in bonds of a limit which holds it on all sides.\"\n\nThis inference seems pretty straightforward. If the material stuff of the world cannot go in or out of being, if there is anything at all, it must have always exist. It therefore must be eternal and necessary.\n\n## Conclusion: Appearance Versus Reality.\n\nIf Parmenides is correct and the world really is an indivisible, unmoving and unchanging, single thing, what does this say about our experience of the world?\n\nIf reason proves that changes is impossible, and yet our senses still perceive change, what are we supposed to conclude about experience of change?\n\nParmenides thinks we must conclude that \"all change is an illusion\" and further \"our experience of change is a deception\".\n\nThis corollary is perhaps Parmenides' greatest and most troubling contribution to the history of philosophy.\n\nBy pointing out that reason tells us change cannot happen, despite the fact that our senses tell us that change does happen, he has created a dramatic division between \"Reason\" and \"Sense\", \"Reality\" and \"Appearance\". \n\nFor him, reason proves (prior to any experience and sensation) that our senses deceive us and don't provide us with reliable access to the \"real\". \n\nHe insists that reality is really very different than it appears. \n\nThus, if I want to get access to the \"real\", I need to shut out my senses, and uses my reason alone to access what is truly true.\n\nAnd I want to call your attention to this now because this will become Plato's central inheritance from Parmenides.\n","data":{"title":"Class 16 Guided Reading Questions","description":"Parmenides, pp. 55-65 and Zeno, pp. 66-72"},"filePath":"class-16.mdx"},{"content":"\nAs always, please be sure to read the biographical introduction to each of our thinkers.\n\n\u003cQuestionBlock type=\"reading-content\"\u003e\n\u003cQuestion level={1}\u003eWhy does Anaxagoras repeatedly say: \"all things are mixed together\" or \"all things are together\"?\u003c/Question\u003e\n\u003cQuestion level={2}\u003eWhat are the \"things\" he is talking about?\u003c/Question\u003e\n\u003cQuestion level={2}\u003eHow does this allow him to agree with Parmenides that \"nothing every comes into or goes out of existence\"?\u003c/Question\u003e\n\u003c/QuestionBlock\u003e\n\n\u003cQuestionBlock type=\"reading-content\"\u003e\n\u003cQuestion level={1}\u003eWhat does Anaxagoras say about the concept of mind (nous)?
