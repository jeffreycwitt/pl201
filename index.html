This doubt and concern will be the focus of *Meditation* 1.\n\nBut Descartes is not only critic. He does not just want to cast doubt; he wants to also find a **new foundation** for certainty. So we will want to observe his method in *Meditations* 2 and 3 for how he thinks he can find certainty after doubting everything he previously held to be true. \n\nWe will also want to observe the pros and cons of this method. What kinds of things might it give us certainty about? Are there limitations to how far this certainty extends?\n\nWith that in mind, below are some guided reading questions to help us navigate *Meditation* 1.\n\n\u003cQuestionBlock type=\"reading-content\"\u003e\n  \u003cQuestion level={1}\u003eFocus first on paragraph 1.\u003c/Question\u003e\n  \u003cQuestion level={2}\u003eWhat is problem does Descartes thinks he is facing?\u003c/Question\u003e\n  \u003cQuestion level={2}\u003eWhat is he searching for that he thinks will help him resolve this problem?\u003c/Question\u003e\n\u003c/QuestionBlock\u003e\n\n\u003cQuestionBlock type=\"reading-content\"\u003e\n  \u003cQuestion level={1}\u003eFocus now on paragraph 2.\u003c/Question\u003e\n  \u003cQuestion level={2}\u003eDoes Descartes think he needs to prove every one of his beliefs false?
