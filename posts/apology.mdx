<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">
<Question level={1}>In the open pages Socrates suggests that he is not a skilled or persuasive political speaker (17b-17d)</Question>
<Question level={2}>Does this tell us something about Socrates? What he values, where he has devoted his time?</Question>
<Question level={2}>Why might it seem important to the average Athenian to be skilled in public persuasion?</Question>
<Question level={2}>By spending his time elsewhere, and not in the political arena, what value has chosen instead?</Question>
<Question level={2}>Why might it be difficult to pursue the goals associated with a skilled political life and the goals Socrates has chosen at the same time? Are there reasons to think these goals might are incompatible?</Question>

<Question level={1}>What are the two different accusations level at Socrates? How does this "structure" of the Dialogue" (18b-e, p. 23)</Question>

Tip: When reading a Platonic dialogue, also look for hints or clues to the internal structure of the work. This structure can help identify distinct stems in the argument or different themes being addressed.

<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">
<Question level={1}>If the first set of accusations are not true, what did Socrates do that made people so angry? (20b and following)</Question>
<Question level={2}>Consder the important statement: "What has caused my reputation a certain kind of wisdom?" What do you think Socrates mean by this? What kind of "wisdom" is this?</Question>
<Question level={2}>Why does this wisdom end up making everyone so angry? Why does his constant examination of self and others irritate everyone so much?</Question>
<Question level={2}>Does this hint at why it might be difficult to pursue both power and truth or justice? How so?</Question>
<Question level={3}>Consider Socrates statement at the top of page 28 (23b)</Question>

<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">
Notice the structural shift to the second set of accusations at 24b (p. 28).

<Question level={2}>What's the basic accusation and response?</Question>
</QuestionBlock>

<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">

It seems like there is another important structural shift at on p. 32 (28b), where Socrates asks himself if he has made the right choice: "Are you not ashamed, Socrates, to have followed the kind of occupation that has led to your being now in danger of death?"

<Question level={1}>How does Socrates respond to this question?</Question>
<Question level={2} type="readding-discussion">How do you feel about his response? Do you find it compelling? Why or why not?</Question>
<Question level={2}>Why does Socrates think think the fear of death is a kind of ignorance?</Question>
<Question level={2}>What does Socrates "know" with certainty that he should avoid at all costs?</Question>

</QuestionBlock>
<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">
<Question level={1}>Consider page 34 (30b), why would gaining power to stay alive at the cost of losing justice, order, or truth be a bad trade-off?</Question>
<Question level={2}>Consider especially the line "Wealth does not bring about excellence, but excellence makes wealth and everything else good for men, both individually and collectively"</Question>
<Question level={2}>See also p. 42 (39b)</Question>

<Question level={1}>Finally consider pg. 35 (30d), why, according to Socrates, will the perpetrator of injustice be more greately harmed than the victim of injustice (in this case Scorates)?</Question>
