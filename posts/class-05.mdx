<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">
<Question level={1}>What do you think is Meno's basic difficulty at the opening of this dialogue? Why is he not able to define virtue? </Question>
<Question level={2}>How does this difficulty illustrate the difference between a definition and instances of that definition (70a-80d)?</Question>
</QuestionBlock>

<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">
<Question level={1}>As Socrates turns to look for his own definition of virtue, what objection does he face (80d-e)?</Question>
<Question level={2}>How does he attempt to answer that objection?
  <Answer>(Hint: what does he mean by recollection?) (81b-82a)</Answer>
</Question> 
</QuestionBlock>

<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">
<Question level={1}>How does Socrates try to illustrate his theory of recollection through his
interaction with the slave boy (82b and following)?</Question>
<Question level={2}>To help you understand this complicated exchange note that Plato is trying to get the slave boy to recognize the following geometrical truth: A square
(BEHD) whose area is twice that of a given square (ABCD) is the square (BEHD) formed using the diagonal of the square (ABCD) as one of its
four sides.</Question>

<Question level={2}>During the exchange, does Socrates ever teach the boy or give the boy new information? Or does the boy discover everything for himself?</Question>
<Question type="reading-discussion" level={2}>Can you think of other examples of this kind of learning? Can you think of an example where you must have already known "something", but if someone had asked you before, you would have probably said you didn't know it?</Question>

<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">
<Question level={1}>What is the difference between knowledge and opinion that begins to be discussed at 97b?</Question>
<Question level={2}>How does Socrates illustrate this difference with his obscure reference to the statues of Daedalus and runaway slaves?</Question>
<Question level={2}>How does one "tie" down an opinion so that it becomes knowledge (98a)?</Question>
</QuestionBlock>

<QuestionBlock type="reading-discussion">
<Question level={1}>If holding a "true opinion/belief" means that we believe what is true (that is, we have an accurate belief about the world), why do we need something called "knowledge"? </Question>
<Question level={2}>In Plato's terms, why is better to have a true opinion that has been "tied down"?</Question>
<Question level={2}>Can you think of some concrete situations where "true opinion" might not be sufficient, perhaps a situation where having "true opinion" but not knowledge is dangerous or simply unsatisfying?</Question>
