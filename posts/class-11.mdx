<Question level={1}>What are some possible definitions of a "basic" belief?</Question>
</QuestionBlock>
<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">
<Question level={1}>Versions of foundationalism suggest that "perceptual experiences" either help create basic beliefs or are themselves basic beliefs. But these are justified basic beliefs only when they are "reliable". Think about your experiences throughout your life: when do you take your perceptual experiences to be reliable? We all have experiences when our senses have deceived us, so what allows us to recognize most "perceptual experiences" as reliable and sufficient for forming the foundations of all our other beliefs? Does belief in reliability introduce a new belief, more basic than our "perceptual experience"?</Question>

<Question level={1}>What is the relationship of basic beliefs to non-basic beliefs?</Question>

<Question level={2}>What fundamental tenet of Foundationalism does Coherentism reject?</Question>
<Question level={2}>Are there good reasons for this? Are you able to account for all your beliefs by tracing them back to foundational basic beliefs? Is that even possible?</Question>
<Question level={2}>How does Coherentism offer an alternative?</Question>
</QuestionBlock>
<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">
<Question level={1}>Given the coherentists rejection of "basic beliefs", what challenge do they face?</Question>

<QuestionBlock type="reading-discussion">
<Question level={1}>Why might theories of justification be relevant to today's problem of addressing "fake news" and "misinformation"?</Question>
<Question level={2}>i. Does Foundationalism or Coherentism provide a way to escape from misinformation? Does one do this better than the other?</Question>
<Question level={2}>Might Foundationalism run the risk of creating an impossible burden for justification that can never be reached? Why? </Question>
<Question level={2}>Might Coherentism create the possibility that people in different "filter bubbles" are "justified" in holding inconsistent or contradictory beliefs about the world? Is this concern captured in the critique that a "fiction can be perfectly coherent"? How so?
