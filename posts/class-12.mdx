# Epistemology/Logic Exam Review Sheet

## Exam Format

The first part of the exam will consist of a set of objective questions about epistemology, the
basic components of reasoning, categorical logic terminology, and formal and informal fallacies.
The second part will include a couple of informal arguments that I will ask you to analyze and
evaluate (i.e. identify the figure, mood, and validity or fallacy committed, etc.). The third part
will consist of an essay question.

## Key Ideas and Terms to Review


* Plato's Meno
  * Deductive and inductive reasoning.
  * The Learner's Paradox.
    * Plato's notion of recollection as a response to the Learner's Paradox.
  * The difference between knowledge and opinion.


* Aristotle
  * Aristotle's response to the Learner's Paradox
  * The definition of a "demonstration".
  * The idea of "knowledge without qualification".
    * How is this different from "qualified" or "virtual" or "implicit" knowledge?
  * What it means for premises to be "explanatory" and why this is important.
  * What it means for premises to be "immediate and primary" and why this is important.
  * Aristotle's idea of induction (PostAn II, c. 19) and its relationship to the immediate and primary principles of a demonstration.
    * Why does this allow Aristotle to reject Plato's idea of recollection or a theory of innate ideas?
  * Consider in particular how this allows Aristotle to say that all learning requires prior knowledge and that first principles are neither innate/recollected nor acquired from a prior deduction.


* Categorical Logic
  * How to recognize a conclusion and premises
  * How a syllogism relates to Aristotle's idea of demonstration
  * The four types of categorical propositions
  * Quantity
  * Quality
  * Distribution
  * The major, minor, and middle term
  * Venn diagrams
  * Five rules of syllogistic reasoning and the five corresponding formal fallacies

* Informal Fallacies
  * Be able to define and give an example of the following 10 informal fallacies:
    * Post hoc, ergo propter hoc
    * Correlation proves causation
    * Hasty Generalization
    * False Dilemma
    * Begging the Question
    * Slippery Slope
    * Definitional dodge
    * Ad hominem
    * Appeal to the Gallery
    * Argument from Ignorance


* Foundationalism and Coherentism
  * Why the Infinite Regress Problem motivates Foundationalism
  * Basic vs. Non-Basic Beliefs
  * Strong vs. Modest Foundationalism
  * Why Modest Foundationalism modifies the definition of knowledge and what counts as justification.
  * How Coherentism tries to overcome the difficulties of Foundationalism.
  * Two difficulties that Coherentism faces.


## III. Essay Questions

In preparation for the essay portion, consider the follow questions:

* Generally, what are the aims of "epistemology" and how does it relate to logic?
  * What are the goals of epistemology? How does logic function as a tool to help us
achieve these goals?
* What is the Learner's Paradox?
  * What is Plato's theory of recollection and how does it relate to the learner's paradox?
  * How does Aristotle attempt to resolve the Learner's Paradox?
* How does "graphing" a syllogism illustrate Aristotle's idea of "learning" as moving from knowing in a "qualified way" to knowing the same thing in a new "unqualified way"?
* In what way does Aristotle's notion of inductive knowledge assist a demonstration?
  * Why might a demonstration even require prior inductive knowledge? (For a review of inductive knowledge, see Posterior Analytics, Book II, c. 19.)
  * How might induction still be an example of Aristotle's assertion that "all learning requires previous cognition"?
  * In what way is this an alternative to Plato's theory of recollection?
