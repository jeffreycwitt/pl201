# Parmenides

<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">
<Question level={1}>Please make sure to read the editorial introduction to the fragments from Parmenides.</Question>
<Question level={2}>According to this introduction, what are the three parts of Parmenides poem?</Question>
</QuestionBlock>
<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">
<Question level={1}>What is the central message of the section of his poem titled "Truth" (see fragments 2-8)?</Question>
<Question level={2}>What conclusion does Parmenides reach about the possibility of change (see esp. 8.12-22)?</Question>
<Question level={2}>What kinds of reasons does he offer for this claim? How might it connect to the two different "routes" introduced in fragment 6 or the division between "that which is" and "that which is not"?</Question>
</QuestionBlock>
<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">
<Question level={1}>What is the central message of the third section titled Doxa, which begins at 8.50?</Question>
<Question level={2}>Why are the opinions of mortals "deceitful"?</Question>
<Question level={2}>Consider especially the "opinion" (or doxa) in fragment 19. How does this "opinion" compare to the truth asserted in the earlier section?</Question>

# Parmenides vs. Anaximenes

Another way to think about Parmenides' contribution is to come back to Anaximenes's original position. Parmenides looked at Anaximenes's account of the world and asked some troubling questions.

Anaximenes's used the different degrees of "density" (i.e. the space between air particles) to explain qualitative difference.

[But recall our earlier 3D model illustrating Anaximenes's position](class-14#anaximenes-demo). Then ask, what is the "stuff" between the "cubes"? In other words, what is the space between the air particles?


In this example, explore the "sphere" below. Try especially to go "inside" the sphere? (a "mouse scroll" should allow you to move inside and back out of the sphere). What do you see there? 

<BabylonViewerWrapper2/>

After exploring the "sphere", consider the following questions:

<QuestionBlock type="reading-discussion">
  <Question level={1}>What is the sphere?</Question> 
  <Question level={1}>And consequently, what is the stuff between the cubes in which those cubes are suspended or floating?</Question>
</QuestionBlock>

<QuestionBlock type="reading-discussion">
  <Question level={1}>Is it NOTHING?</Question> 
  <Question level={2}>If so, since each object has the same amount of cubes and "nothing" between them, shouldn't they all be qualitatively the same?</Question>
</QuestionBlock>

<QuestionBlock type="reading-discussion">
  <Question level={1}>Is it SOMETHING?</Question> 
  <Question level={2}>If it is something, what, according Anaximenes must it be?</Question>
  <Question level={2}>And if the space between the cubes is just more of this "something", why would this threaten Anaximenes's explanation qualitative difference?</Question>

# Zeno

<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">
<Question level={1}>According to the editorial introduction to the section on Zeno, what is Zeno's relation to Parmenides?</Question> 
<Question level={2}>How is Zeno trying to show the consequences of Parmenides's position?</Question>
<Question level={2}>Consider how this is argued for in fragment 1 (p. 66-67).</Question>
</QuestionBlock>
<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">
<Question level={1}>Consider fragment 5 (p. 68) closely. How does this fragment attempt to prove that if there are many things, then, paradoxically, these many things must be both finite and infinite at the same time?</Question>
</QuestionBlock>
<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">
<Question level={1}>Consider fragment 6 and 7. How do these arguments attempt to prove that our ideas of motion are impossible and contradictory?</Question>
</QuestionBlock>
<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">
<Question level={1}>Consider fragment 12. How does Zeno argue for the absurdity of thinking about "place" as something that exists?</Question>
</QuestionBlock>
<QuestionBlock type="reading-discussion">
<Question level={1}>What is your reaction to Zenoâ€™s argument against motion in fragments 6 and 7?</Question>
<Question level={2}>Do the arguments seem convincing? In what way?</Question>
<Question level={2}>Since Zeno, like us, clearly has the experience of motion in his daily life, what do you think the ultimate goal of his arguments is? What might he be trying say about our sense-experience of the world?</Question>
