### Questions for Copleston and Russell, 'A Debate on the Argument from Contingency'

First a note: Before getting bogged down in the details of this debate, try to step back and appreciate the whole. Whether or not you can follow every argument or claim that is made, observe in general how important the notion of "cause" or "explanation" is in this debate. Here we can we see how critical these metaphysical concepts are to foundational questions like, 'Does God exists?'. A key goal here is just to see how debates in metaphysics are conducted in the modern area and to appreciate how the questions that occupied the ancient philosophers continue to be relevant today.

  <Question level={3}>Why does he think contemporary physicists might support his point (i.e. that while there might be particular chains of cause and effect, there need not be an explanation for everything or for the totality?)</Question>
