# Some Background

We're going to turn a text called *Meditations on First Philosophy* by Rene Descartes. 

This text was first written in 1641 (so many years after Plato and Aristotle) and it is our first introduction to a modern philosopher. 

The reason we're going to focus on this text (apart from it being a classic, and therefore *foundational* text) is that it is going to ask us to look  closely at the process of induction. 

Specifically, it is going to pose questions about the level of certainty that can be generated from the kind of inductive reasoning described by Aristotle (e.g. starting from sense observations, then moving to memory, then experience, and finally developing a general principle or definition).

Descartes is going to raise some serious doubts about whether certainty can be achieved in this way. This doubt and concern will be the focus of *Meditation* 1.

But Descartes is not only critic. He does not just want to cast doubt; he wants to also find a **new foundation** for certainty. So we will want to observe his method in *Meditations* 2 and 3 for how he thinks he can find certainty after doubting everything he previously held to be true. 

We will also want to observe the pros and cons of this method. What kinds of things might it give us certainty about? Are there limitations to how far this certainty extends?

With that in mind, below are some guided reading questions to help us navigate *Meditation* 1.

  <Question level={1}>Focus now on paragraph 2.</Question>
  <Question level={2}>Does Descartes think he needs to prove every one of his beliefs false? Why or why not?</Question>
  <Question level={2}>In order to remove all beliefs that could possible be wrong, what does he think it is sufficient to do?</Question>
</QuestionBlock>

<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">
  <Question level={1}>What kind of principle (or source of knowledge) does he focus on in paragraph 4 and 5</Question>

<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">
  <Question level={1}>What new kind of principle of certainty does he begin to focus on in paragraphs 6, 7, and 8?</Question>
  <Question level={2}>At first, why do these kinds of beliefs seem to be more certain?</Question>
  <Question level={2}>In paragraph 9 what reason(s) does he offer to think that even these kinds of beliefs can be doubted?</Question>
  <Question level={2}>Again, does he given an argument for this?</Question>
