## Meditation 2 

<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">
  <Question level={1}>How does Descartes summarize his current problem and goal in paragraph 1?</Question>
  <Question level={2}>In what way is he like Archimedes?</Question>
</QuestionBlock>

<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">
  <Question level={1}>How does Paragraph 2 review the results achieved in Meditation 1?</Question>
</QuestionBlock>

<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">
  <Question level={1}>Has Descartes made a break through in paragraph 3? Has he found something indubitable?</Question>
  <Question level={2} type="reading-discussion">Spend sometime reflecting here.</Question>
  <Question level={2} type="reading-discussion">What has he found?</Question>
  <Question level={2} type="reading-discussion">Why does he think this belief must be certain? What gives him confidence that it must exist and cannot be doubted</Question>
</QuestionBlock>

In paragraph 4, 5, and following, Descartes begins to examine what can be said about this "existent thing".

<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">
  <Question level={1}>What were some of the typical beliefs that Descartes used to attribute to this existent thing? Why is he no longer comfortable holding these beliefs? (Para 5)</Question>
  <Question level={1}>In para 6, what is the only "indubitable" characteristic he feels comfortable contributing to this existent thing? Why?</Question>
  <Question level={2} type="reading-discussion">Reflect a little yourself: does this feel like an "indubitable" claim or do you still have doubts?</Question>
  <Question level={2} type="reading-discussion">Are there any other attributes about yourself that you think are indubitable? Why or why not?</Question>
  <Question level={1}>How does his reasoning in para 6, escape the very difficult problem of an "Evil/Malicious/Deceiving God"? What must be certain even if he is being deceived by such a God?</Question>

</QuestionBlock>

In paragraph 8 and following, the inquiry goes deeper. Having established that is a thinking thing, Descartes examines what it means to be a thinking thing.

<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">
  <Question level={1}>What does he come up with here in para 8? What does it mean to be a "thinking thing"? Can you make a list of attributes?</Question>
  <Question level={2} type="reading-discussion">Spend some time evaluating his conclusion.</Question>
  <Question level={3} type="reading-discussion">Does this seem like an accurate and "indubitable" description of a thinking thing?</Question>
  <Question level={3} type="reading-discussion">Is there more that you could "indubitably" add to this description? What would it be?</Question>
</QuestionBlock>

Read paragraph 11-16 carefully. Paragraphs 11-16 include Descartes' extremely famous example of the "wax seal".

<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">
  <Question level={1}>What is Descartes trying to prove with this example?</Question>
  <Question level={1}>How is this intended to overturn conventional thinking about the certainty of what we sensibly perceive?</Question>
  <Question level={1}>In the closing paragraph (para 16), how does his examination of "perception" of the wax give him confidence that his "mental perception" of himself as a thinking thing cannot be doubted?</Question>

## Meditation 3 

Meditation 3 is a slightly longer and more difficult Meditation, so let me provide a little bit of background and then focus your attention on just a few reading questions.

At the center of Mediation 3 is a desire to avoid the problem presented by the possibility of an evil, deceiving God. 

This possibility was the great obstacle standing in the way of our indubitable knowledge that we exist to confidence to equal confidence that the physical world that we perceive is real. 

But given this problem, the escape is somewhat clear. If Descartes can prove that there exists a God and that this God is good (and has no evil), then this possibility of deception can be removed. 

But notice some limitations. Descartes cannot prove God exists by pointing to the physical world (which he knows only through he senses) and assert that there must be a good God that created this world. 

He cannot do this because the very existence of this physical world is in doubt. 

The only thing that is certain is that he exists as a thinking thing. And this his starting point.

Paragraphs 1-16 are important background, but the heart of the proof begins in paragraph 17 and follows to the end.

<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">
  <Question level={1}>As you read, can you develop a general sense of his proof for God's existence. How does he use his "thought" of God or the "idea of God" that he indubitably possess to conclude that a Good God must exist.</Question>
  <Question level={2}>What is unique about the idea of God in Descartes' mind (see for example para 22)</Question>
  <Question level={2}>How does this uniqueness lead to the conclusion that a good God must exist? (see for example paragraphs 32, 37, and 38)</Question>
  <Question level={1} type="reading-discussion">Are you convinced by this proof for God's existence? Why or why not?</Question>
