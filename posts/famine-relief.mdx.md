Read each of the articles on Famine Relief by Wellman and Cohen and ask yourself two main questions. 

* First, what is the **Main Conclusion or Position** being put forward by each author?
* Second, can you identify at least two main premises for their position? How do these premises work together to support their main position?

Note that Wellman and Cohen are arguing for opposing positions. So, look especially for the **different** starting premises that lead them to their **opposing** conclusions.
