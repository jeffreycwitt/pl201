description: David Hume, Enquiry on Human Understanding, "Of the Idea of Necessary Connexion"
order: 12
---

Paragraph 48 serves as kind of introduction. He notes here that the "chief obstacle" to progress in science is the "obscurity of ideas and the ambiguity of terms"

<QuestionBlock type="reading-discussion">
  <Question level={1}>Can we reflect on this on a moment? Can we think of examples where the "ambiguity of terms" prevents scientific or intellectual progress? (This is good review work for our upcoming exam)</Question>
  <Question level={2}>Consider our work in epistemology thus far in the semester. How has the idea/meaning of "learning" been ambiguous and created puzzles and obstacles to progress?</Question>
  <Question level={2}>In which way has the word "to know" been full of ambiguity? (Consider the different between when I say "my Dog knows something" and when I say "I know something")</Question>
  <Question level={2}>How did Plato and Aristotle both try to make progress by being more precise about words like "learning" and "knowing"</Question>
</QuestionBlock>

Turning now to Paragraph 49.

<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">
  <Question level={1}>What idea or term does David Hume think is the most ambiguous and uncertain?</Question>
</QuestionBlock>

<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">
  <Question level={1}>According Hume (para 49) what is the origin of all our ideas?
    <Answer>
      "Impressions" are information we get from our internal and external senses. 
      The critical part of Hume's position is that, as he says, "all our ideas are copies of our impressions", thus "it is impossible for us to think anything" of which we do not have a prior sense impression?
    </Answer>
  </Question>
  <Question level={1}>How does this compare to Descartes? Does Descartes think it is possible for the mind to have an idea that is not derived from our sense experience?</Question>
  <Question level={1}>How does this compare to Plato? or Aristotle? Does Hume sound more like Plato or more Like Aristotle</Question>
  <Question level={2}>Why?</Question>
</QuestionBlock>
<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">
  <Question level={1}>How does identifying the origin ideas suggest a path for clarifying ideas and making them precise?
    <Answer>
      Hint: Consider the sentence in para 49 that begins with "But when we have pushed up definitions..." and follow it to the end of the paragraph.
    </Answer>

In paragraph 50, Hume begins to follow the method outlined in Para 49 in order to reach more clarity about the idea of a "necessary connection" or a "cause".

<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">
  <Question level={1}>According to Hume, when we trace the idea of a "necessary connection" back to its original impressions, what do we find?</Question>
  <Question level={2}>Does he think we find an impression of a "necessary connection"? In other words, does he think we see or hear such a connection?</Question>
  <Question level={2}>What is the purpose of his billiard-ball example? What point is he trying to make with this example?</Question> 
  <Question level={2}>If we never actually have a sense impression of a "cause", what kind of impression do we have that leads to our idea of a cause?</Question>
  <Question level={3}>Reflect a little bit? Do you think he is correct? Why or why not? Can you identify and experience where you felt like you "sensed" a "cause" or "necessary" connection?</Question>
</QuestionBlock>

In paragraphs 51 and 52, Hume turns to our "internal impressions" and looks to see if we every have an experiential impression of a "necessary connection"

<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">
  <Question level={1}>Why does he think the will's ability to move the body is mysterious?</Question>
  <Question level={1}>Why does this suggest that even here, we do not have a real impression of necessary connection or cause?</Question>
  <Question level={2}>How does the example of the man in sudden paralysis (middle of para 52) illustrate this point?</Question>
</QuestionBlock>

Hume begins at transition at paragraph 58 (Part II)

<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">
  <Question level={1}>Describe the transition we see at the beginning of paragraph 58</Question>
  <Question level={2}>What does Hume think he has shown in Part 1?</Question>
  <Question level={2}>What new task does he intend to accomplish in Part 2?</Question>
