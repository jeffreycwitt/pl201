## Parmenides vs. Anaximenes

Another way to think about Parmenides' contribution is to come back to Anaximenes's original position. Parmenides looked at Anaximenes's account of the world and asked some troubling questions.

Anaximenes's used the different degrees of "density" (i.e. the space between air particles) to explain qualitative difference.

[But recall our earlier 3D model illustrating Anaximenes's position](class-15#anaximenes-demo). Then ask, what is the "stuff" between the "cubes"? In other words, what is the space between the air particles?

In this example, explore the "sphere" below. Try especially to go "inside" the sphere? (a "mouse scroll" should allow you to move inside and back out of the sphere). What do you see there?

After exploring the "sphere", consider the following questions:

<QuestionBlock type="reading-discussion">
  <Question level={1}>What is the sphere?</Question> 
  <Question level={1}>And consequently, what is the stuff between the cubes in which those cubes are suspended or floating?</Question>
</QuestionBlock>

<QuestionBlock type="reading-discussion">
  <Question level={1}>Is it NOTHING?</Question> 
  <Question level={2}>If so, since each object has the same amount of cubes and "nothing" between them, shouldn't they all be qualitatively the same?</Question>
</QuestionBlock>

<QuestionBlock type="reading-discussion">
  <Question level={1}>Is it SOMETHING?</Question> 
  <Question level={2}>If it is something, what, according Anaximenes must it be?</Question>
  <Question level={2}>And if the space between the cubes is just more of this "something", why would this threaten Anaximenes's explanation of qualitative difference?</Question>

# Class Notes on Parmenides

## From Nothingness to a World without Change

Parmenides's central positions comes from taking the idea of "nothingness" very seriously. 

As an example, stop for a moment and try to think of "nothing". 

<QuestionBlock type="reading-discussion">
  <Question level={1}>Can you do it?</Question>
  <Question level={2}>What do you think of when try to think of "nothing"? Describe what you "see" when you do thisn</Question>
</QuestionBlock>

Parmenides claims it can't be done. If you're thinking of "anything", then you are still thinking of "something". 

Thus, if you claim to be successfully thinking of "nothing", then you are actually still thinking of "something".

For Parmenides, "nothing" is completely unintelligible.

This might seem like a small claim, but Parmenides draws out some big implications from the unintelligibility of nothingness.

The most important implication is what it means for one of our most common experiences, namely our experience of change.

In direct opposition to Heraclitus, Parmenides asserts that change is actually not happening and cannot happen. Despite what your senses tell you, nothing changes.

Why is Parmenides so confident? 

He gives us a version of the following argument.

1) First, if something comes to be from "already being", then it already is, and therefore it did not actually come to be. 

Consider P. 60, fragment 8, line 18-20)

2) Second, if something comes to be from "non-being", then it comes from nothing. (But nothing, if it is really nothing, can become something because it would first have to be something. Parmenides's view is often captured in the phrase "nothing comes from nothing".)

Consider what he says on p. 59, fragment 8, line 6: 

> "For what birth will you seek out for it? How and from what did it grow? For what is not I will allow you neither to say nor to think…"

We could formalize this argument even more: 

1)	If E (Exists), then A (Already exists) (p. 60, fragment 8, line 18-20)
2)	If ~E (Not Exists), then N (nothing, because nothing comes from nothing) (p. 59, frag. 8, line 5-17)
3)	Things either E (exists) or ~E (do not exists)
C)  Therefore, Everything A (Already exists) or N (is Nothing).

<QuestionBlock type="reading-discussion">
  <Question level={1}>Does this argument remind you of anything we've seen before? </Question>
  <Question level={2}>Why do you think the arguments are so similar?</Question>
</QuestionBlock>

The result is that there is only one thing in the universe; it is the "What is" and it never changes in any way.

## Other Descriptions of the "What is"

Let's consider more closely what this "What is" or "Being" is that Parmenides says never goes in or out of existence. 

Here you might consider closely Fragment 8, line 23 and following. I'll focus on four key characteristics below.

### 1. It is necessarily one, unified, and indivisible

<QuestionBlock type="reading-discussion">
  <Question level={1}>Why can't the "What is" be divided?</Question>
</QuestionBlock>

Fredrick Copelston explains as follows:  

> "Because if it is not one but divided, then it must be divided by something other than itself. But Being cannot be divided by something other than itself, for besides being there is nothing."

Consider the following example. 

Imagine I have a line. 

<hr/>
<br/>

And then I want to cut this line into distinct parts, so I break it up, like so: 

-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-

If the horizontal line represents the "what is", and the "what is" is the only thing in the world that exists, what are the vertical lines in the above illustration? 

According to Parmenides, they can only be more of the "what is". Thus, the division is only an illusion. It is actually impossible to break up the line or divide it because whatever you try to use to separate or divide the line will just be more of the line itself.

### 2. It is complete - nothing can be added to it.

<QuestionBlock type="reading-discussion">
  <Question level={1}>Why might it seem like a problem if something could be "added" to the "What is"?</Question>
</QuestionBlock>

Consider Fragment 8.24: 

> "And not all more in any way, which would keep it from holding together or at all less, but it is full of what-is…"

Again Copelston states "…anything that was added to 'being', would itself be MORE being" (and thus would already be a part of being).

### 3. It is immovable, unchanging, and continuous

Consider Fragment 8:25: 

> "But unchanging in the limits of great bonds it is without starting or ceasing…"

<QuestionBlock type="reading-discussion">
  <Question level={1}>Why can't the "What is" move?</Question>
</QuestionBlock>

You might consider, to where would it move. If it tries to move to another place, what will already be there before it gets there? Won't the "What is" simply find that it was always already there.

### 4. It is necessary and eternal.

The "What is" can never have a first moment in which it begins to be. Nor can it every cease to be.

Consider Fragment 8.30:

> "Remaining the same and in the same and by itself it lies and so remains there fixed; for mighty necessity holds it in bonds of a limit which holds it on all sides."

This inference seems pretty straightforward. If the material stuff of the world cannot go in or out of being, if there is anything at all, it must have always exist. It therefore must be eternal and necessary.

## Conclusion: Appearance Versus Reality.

If Parmenides is correct and the world really is an indivisible, unmoving and unchanging, single thing, what does this say about our experience of the world?

If reason proves that changes is impossible, and yet our senses still perceive change, what are we supposed to conclude about experience of change?

Parmenides thinks we must conclude that "all change is an illusion" and further "our experience of change is a deception".

This corollary is perhaps Parmenides's greatest and most troubling contribution to the history of philosophy.

By pointing out that reason tells us change cannot happen, despite the fact that our senses tell us that change does happen, he has created a dramatic division between "Reason" and "Sense", "Reality" and "Appearance". 

For him, reason proves (prior to any experience and sensation) that our senses deceive us and don't provide us with reliable access to the "real". 

He insists that reality is really very different than it appears. 

Thus, if I want to get access to the "real", I need to shut out my senses, and uses my reason alone to access what is truly true.
