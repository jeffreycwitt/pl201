### Questions for Copleston and Russell, 'A Debate on the Argument from Contingency', pp. 5-11

First a note: Before getting bogged down in the details of this debate, try to step back and appreciate the whole. Whether or not you can follow every argument or claim that is made, observe in general how important the notion of "cause" or "explanation" is in this debate. Here we can we see how critical these metaphysical concepts are to foundational questions like, 'Does God exists?'. A key goal here is just to see how debates in metaphysics are in conducted in the modern area and to appreciate how the questions that occupied the ancient philosophers continue to be relevant today.


<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">
  <Question level={1}>What definition of God does Copleston begin with?</Question>
  <Question level={2} type="reading-discussion">Is this similar to or different from the "unmmoved mover" that Aristotle discovers in book 12 of the Metaphysics?</Question>
</QuestionBlock>

<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">
  <Question level={1}>What is Copleston's definition of a "contingent being"? (p. 6b)</Question>
  <Question level={1}>What is a "necessary being"?</Question>
  <Question level={1}>Why does Copleston think a universe of "contingent beings" demands a "necessary being"?</Question>
</QuestionBlock>

After considerable back and forth on pages 6-8, at the very bottom of page 8b, Russell points out that the real crux of the matter is that Copleston believes everything must have a "sufficient reason" (p. 8b, bottom).

<QuestionBlock type="reading-content">
  <Question level={1}>Can you get a sense of why Copleston believes there must be a "sufficient reason" for everything? </Question>
  <Question level={2}>What happens to our understanding of the universe if there is a sufficient reason for everything? (See page 9b.)</Question>
  <Question level={1}>Why doesn't this bother Russell?</Question>
  <Question level={2}>While admitting that many particular things have causes, why doesn't he think there must be a cause of the totality?</Question>
  <Question level={3}>What is the argument (by analogy) about "every person who exists having a mother..." (p. 10a) and how does this support his point?</Question>
  <Question level={3}>Why does he think contemporary physicists might support his point (i.e. that while there might be particular chains of cause and effect, there need not be an explanation for everything or for the totality?) (see pp. 10b, 11a, and 11b).</Question>
