I&#x27;ll focus on four key characteristics below.</p><h3>1. It is necessarily one, unified, and indivisible</h3><div class="jsx-d08b00315015a807 main reading-discussion"><div style="padding-left:20px;list-style:disc inside none" class="jsx-eb4452cb9cf14c8d question undefined">Why can&#x27;t the &quot;What is&quot; be divided?</div></div><p>Fredrick Copelston explains as follows:  </p><blockquote><p>&quot;Because if it is not one but divided, then it must be divided by something other than itself. But Being cannot be divided by something other than itself, for besides being there is nothing.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Consider the following example. </p><p>Imagine I have a line. </p><hr/><br/><p>And then I want to cut this line into distinct parts, so I break it up, like so: </p><p>-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-</p><p>If the horizontal line represents the &quot;what is&quot;, and the &quot;what is&quot; is the only thing in the world that exists, what are the vertical lines in the above illustration? </p><p>According to Paremenides, they can only be more of the &quot;what is&quot;. Thus, the division is only an illusion. It is actually impossible to break up the line or divide it because whatever you try to use to separate or divide the line will just be more of the line itself.</p><h3>2. It is complete - nothing can be added to it.</h3><div class="jsx-d08b00315015a807 main reading-discussion"><div style="padding-left:20px;list-style:disc inside none" class="jsx-eb4452cb9cf14c8d question undefined">Why might it seem like a problem if something could be &quot;added&quot; to the &quot;What is&quot;?</div></div><p>Consider Fragment 8.24: </p><blockquote><p>&quot;And not all more in any way, which would keep it from holding together or at all less, but it is full of what-isâ€¦&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Again Copelston states &quot;â€¦anything that was added to &#x27;being&#x27;, would itself be MORE being&quot; (and thus would already be a part of being).</p><h3>3. It is immovable, unchanging, and continuous</h3><p>Consider Fragment 8:25: </p><blockquote><p>&quot;But unchanging in the limits of great bonds it is without starting or ceasingâ€¦&quot;</p></blockquote><div class="jsx-d08b00315015a807 main reading-discussion"><div style="padding-left:20px;list-style:disc inside none" class="jsx-eb4452cb9cf14c8d question undefined">Why can&#x27;t the &quot;What is&quot; move?</div></div><p>You might consider, to where it would it move. If it tries to move to another place, what will already be there before it gets there? Won&#x27;t the &quot;What is&quot; simply find that it was always already there.</p><h3>4. It is necessary and eternal.</h3><p>The &quot;What is&quot; can never have first moment in which it begins to be. Nor can it every cease to be.</p><p>Consider Fragment 8.30:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Remaining the same and in the same and by itself it lies and so remains there fixed; for mighty necessity holds it in bonds of a limit which holds it on all sides.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>This inference seems pretty straightforward. If the material stuff of the world cannot go in or out of being, if there is anything at all, it must have always exist. It therefore must be eternal and necessary.</p><h2>Conclusion: Appearance Versus Reality.</h2><p>If Parmenides is correct and the world really is an indivisible, unmoving and unchanging, single thing, what does this say about our experience of the world?</p><p>If reason proves that changes is impossible, and yet our senses still perceive change, what are we supposed to conclude about experience of change?</p><p>Parmenides thinks we must conclude that &quot;all change is an illusion&quot; and further &quot;our experience of change is a deception&quot;.</p><p>This corollary is perhaps Parmenides&#x27; greatest and most troubling contribution to the history of philosophy.</p><p>By pointing out that reason tells us change cannot happen, despite the fact that our senses tell us that change does happen, he has created a dramatic division between &quot;Reason&quot; and &quot;Sense&quot;, &quot;Reality&quot; and &quot;Appearance&quot;. </p><p>For him, reason proves (prior to any experience and sensation) that our senses deceive us and don&#x27;t provide us with reliable access to the &quot;real&quot;. </p><p>He insists that reality is really very different than it appears. </p><p>Thus, if I want to get access to the &quot;real&quot;, I need to shut out my senses, and uses my reason alone to access what is truly true.</p><p>And I want to call your attention to this now because this will become Plato&#x27;s central inheritance from Parmenides.</p></main></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"source":{"compiledSource":"var d=Object.defineProperty,p=Object.defineProperties;var c=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors;var s=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols;var a=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty,r=Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable;var h=(e,t,o)=\u003et in e?d(e,t,{enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0,value:o}):e[t]=o,n=(e,t)=\u003e{for(var o in t||(t={}))a.call(t,o)\u0026\u0026h(e,o,t[o]);if(s)for(var o of s(t))r.call(t,o)\u0026\u0026h(e,o,t[o]);return e},l=(e,t)=\u003ep(e,c(t));var u=(e,t)=\u003e{var o={};for(var i in e)a.call(e,i)\u0026\u0026t.indexOf(i)\u003c0\u0026\u0026(o[i]=e[i]);if(e!=null\u0026\u0026s)for(var i of s(e))t.indexOf(i)\u003c0\u0026\u0026r.call(e,i)\u0026\u0026(o[i]=e[i]);return o};const makeShortcode=e=\u003efunction(o){return console.warn(\"Component \"+e+\" was not imported, exported, or provided by MDXProvider as global scope\"),mdx(\"div\",n({},o))},QuestionBlock=makeShortcode(\"QuestionBlock\"),Question=makeShortcode(\"Question\"),BabylonViewerWrapper2=makeShortcode(\"BabylonViewerWrapper2\"),layoutProps={},MDXLayout=\"wrapper\";function MDXContent(o){var i=o,{components:e}=i,t=u(i,[\"components\"]);return mdx(MDXLayout,l(n(n({},layoutProps),t),{components:e,mdxType:\"MDXLayout\"}),mdx(\"h1\",null,\"Reading Questions\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Work through these reading questions first, but consider the class notes that follow.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Parmenides\"),mdx(QuestionBlock,{type:\"reading-content\",mdxType:\"QuestionBlock\"},mdx(Question,{level:1,mdxType:\"Question\"},\"Please make sure to read the editorial introduction to the fragments from Parmenides.\"),mdx(Question,{level:2,mdxType:\"Question\"},\"According to this introduction, what are the three parts of Parmenides poem?\")),mdx(QuestionBlock,{type:\"reading-content\",mdxType:\"QuestionBlock\"},mdx(Question,{level:1,mdxType:\"Question\"},'What is the central message of the section of his poem titled \"Truth\" (see fragments 2-8)?'),mdx(Question,{level:2,mdxType:\"Question\"},\"What conclusion does Parmenides reach about the possibility of change (see esp. 8.12-22)?\"),mdx(Question,{level:2,mdxType:\"Question\"},'What kinds of reasons does he offer for this claim?
