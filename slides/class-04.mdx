## Plato on Knowledge vs. True Opinion (Meno, p. 89-90, 97a-98a)

S: How do you mean? Will he who has the right opinion not always succeed, as long as his opinion is right?

M: That appears to be so of necessity, and it makes me wonder Socrates, this being the case, why knowledge is prized far more highly than right opinion, and why they are different?

S: Do you know why you wonder, or sha I tell you?

M: By all means tell me.

S: It is because you have paid no attention to the statues of Daedalus, but perhaps there are none in Thessaly

M: What do you have in mind when you say this?

S: That they too run away and escape if one does not tie them down but remain in place if tied down?

M: So what?

S: To acquire an untied work of Daedalus is not worth much, like acquiring a runaway slave, for it does not remain, but it is worth much if tied down, for his works are very beautiful. What am I thinking of when I say this? True opinions. For true opinions, as long as they remain, are a fine thing and all they do is good, but they are not willing to remain long, and they escape from a man's mind, so that they are not worth much until one ties them down by [giving] an account of the reason why.

## PostAn 1.1, (71b5, p. 39)

"But, I think, it is quite possible for us to know in one way what we are learning, 
while being ignorant of it in another way. For what is absurd is not that 
we already know in some way the very thing we are learning; the absurdity arises 
only if we already know it to the precise extent and in the precise way in which we are learning it."

## A Definition of Knowledge (episteme, scientia): PostAn 1.2 (71b10, p. 39)

"We think we know a thing without qualification, and not in the sophistic coincidental way, whenever we think we know the explanation because of which the thing is [so], know that it is the explanation of that thing, and know that it does not admit of being otherwise"

## Method and Criteria for Reaching Knowledge: PostAn  1.2 (71b20, p. 40)

"If, then, knowing is the sort thing we assumed it is, demonstrative knowledge must also be derived from things that are true, primary, immediate, better known than, prior to, and explanatory of the conclusion..."

## Induction: PostAn  2.19 (99b15, p. 66)

"It is evident, then, what deduction and demonstration are and how they come about...But how do we come to know principles, and what state knows them?"

## Induction: PostAn  2.19 (100a4, p. 67)

"From perception, then, as we say, memory arises, and from repeated memory of the same thing experience arises; from a number of memories make up experience. From experience, or [rather] from the whole universal tha thas settled in the soul...arises a principle of craft or of science"
