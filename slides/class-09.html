my youth, many false opinions for true, and that consequently what I afterward based on such
principles was highly doubtful; and from that time I was convinced of the necessity of undertaking
once in my life to rid myself of all the opinions I had adopted, and of commencing anew the work of
building from the foundation, if I desired to establish a firm and abiding superstructure in the
sciences. But as this enterprise appeared to me to be one of great magnitude, I waited until I had
attained an age so mature as to leave me no hope that at any stage of life more advanced I should
be better able to execute my design. On this account, I have delayed so long that I should
henceforth consider I was doing wrong were I still to consume in deliberation any of the time that
now remains for action. To-day, then, since I have opportunely freed my mind from all cares and
am happily disturbed by no passions], and since I am in the secure possession of leisure in a
peaceable retirement, I will at length apply myself earnestly and freely to the general overthrow of
all my former opinions.</li></ol></div><div class="jsx-978bdcd02cdf5be1 slide undefined"><h1>Descartes, Meditation 1, Paragraph 2</h1><ol start="2"><li>But, to this end, it will not be necessary for me to show that the whole of these are false--a point,
perhaps, which I shall never reach; but as even now my reason convinces me that I ought not the
less carefully to withhold belief from what is not entirely certain and indubitable, than from what is
manifestly false, it will be sufficient to justify the rejection of the whole if I shall find in each some
ground for doubt. Nor for this purpose will it be necessary even to deal with each belief individually,
which would be truly an endless labor; but, as the removal from below of the foundation
necessarily involves the downfall of the whole edifice, I will at once approach the criticism of the
principles on which all my former beliefs rested.</li></ol></div><div class="jsx-978bdcd02cdf5be1 slide undefined"><h1>Descartes, Meditation 1, Paragraph 3, 4, 5</h1><p>Question: So, what “principle” does he begin with?
