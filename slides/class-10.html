my youth, many false opinions for true, and that consequently what I afterward based on such
principles was highly doubtful; and from that time I was convinced of the necessity of undertaking
once in my life to rid myself of all the opinions I had adopted, and of commencing anew the work of
building from the foundation, if I desired to establish a firm and abiding superstructure in the
sciences. But as this enterprise appeared to me to be one of great magnitude, I waited until I had
attained an age so mature as to leave me no hope that at any stage of life more advanced I should
be better able to execute my design. On this account, I have delayed so long that I should
henceforth consider I was doing wrong were I still to consume in deliberation any of the time that
now remains for action. To-day, then, since I have opportunely freed my mind from all cares and
am happily disturbed by no passions], and since I am in the secure possession of leisure in a
peaceable retirement, I will at length apply myself earnestly and freely to the general overthrow of
all my former opinions.</li></ol></div><div class="jsx-c09d66d3fcfb9df8 slide undefined"><h1>Descartes, Meditation 1, Paragraph 2</h1><ol start="2"><li>But, to this end, it will not be necessary for me to show that the whole of these are false--a point,

manifestly false, it will be sufficient to justify the rejection of the whole if I shall find in each some
ground for doubt. Nor for this purpose will it be necessary even to deal with each belief individually,
which would be truly an endless labor; but, as the removal from below of the foundation
necessarily involves the downfall of the whole edifice, I will at once approach the criticism of the

all these objects, and] the persuasion that these do not exist otherwise than as I perceive them ?
And further, as I sometimes think that others are in error respecting matters of which they believe
themselves to possess a perfect knowledge, how do I know that I am not also deceived each time I
add together two and three, or number the sides of a square, or form some judgment still more
simple, if more simple indeed can be imagined? But perhaps Deity has not been willing that I
should be thus deceived, for he is said to be supremely good. If, however, it were repugnant to the
goodness of Deity to have created me subject to constant deception, it would seem likewise to be
contrary to his goodness to allow me to be occasionally deceived; and yet it is clear that this is
permitted.</li></ol></div><div class="jsx-c09d66d3fcfb9df8 slide undefined"><iframe width="1200" height="800" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O5b0ZxUWNf0?si=liI0BBhEP3N-dta2&amp;start=0end=71" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen"></iframe></div><div class="jsx-c09d66d3fcfb9df8 slide undefined"><h2>Descartes, Meditation 2, Paragraph 3</h2><ol start="3"><li>But how do I know that there is not something different altogether from the objects I have now enumerated,
of which it is impossible to entertain the slightest doubt? Is there not a God, or some being,
by whatever name I may designate him, who causes these thoughts to arise in my mind?
But why suppose such a being, for it may be I myself am capable of producing them?
Am I, then, at least not something? But I before denied that I possessed senses or a body;
I hesitate, however,for what follows from that? Am I so dependent on the body and the senses that without these I cannot exist?
But I had the persuasion that there was absolutely nothing in the world,
that there was no sky and no earth, neither minds nor bodies;
was I not, therefore, at the same time, persuaded that I did not exist?
Far from it; I assuredly existed, since I was persuaded.
But there is I know not what being, who is possessed at once of the highest power
and the deepest cunning, who is constantly employing all his ingenuity in deceiving me.
Doubtless, then, I exist, since I am deceived; and, let him deceive me as he may,
he can never bring it about that I am nothing,
so long as I shall be conscious that I am something.
So that it must, in fine, be maintained, all things being maturely and carefully considered,
that this proposition (pronunciatum) I am, I exist,
is necessarily true each time it is expressed by me, or conceived in my mind.</li></ol></div><div class="jsx-c09d66d3fcfb9df8 slide undefined"><h2>Descartes, Meditation 2, Paragraph 6</h2><ol start="6"><li>But as to myself, what can I now say that I am, since I suppose there exists an extremely powerful, and, if I may so speak, malignant being, whose whole endeavors are directed toward deceiving me ? Can I affirm that I possess any one of all those attributes of which I have lately spoken as belonging to the nature of body ? After attentively considering them in my own mind, I find none of them that can properly be said to belong to myself. To recount them were idle and tedious. Let us pass, then, to the attributes of the soul. The first mentioned were the powers of nutrition and walking; but, if it be true that I have no body, it is true likewise that I am capable neither of walking nor of being nourished. Perception is another attribute of the soul; but perception too is impossible without the body; besides, I have frequently, during sleep, believed that I perceived objects which I afterward observed I did not in reality perceive. Thinking is another attribute of the soul; and here I discover what properly belongs to myself. This alone is inseparable from me. I am -- I exist: this is certain; but how often? As often as I think; for perhaps it would even happen, if I should wholly cease to think, that I should at the same time altogether cease to be. I now admit nothing that is not necessarily true. I am therefore, precisely speaking, only a thinking thing, that is, a mind (mens sive animus), understanding, or reason, terms whose signification was before unknown to me. I am, however, a real thing, and really existent; but what thing? The answer was, a thinking thing.</li></ol></div><div class="jsx-c09d66d3fcfb9df8 slide undefined"><h2>Descartes, Meditation 3, Paragraph 1</h2><ol><li>I WILL now close my eyes, I will stop my ears, I will turn away my senses from their objects, I will even efface from my consciousness all the images of corporeal things; or at least, because this can hardly be accomplished, I will consider them as empty and false; and thus, holding converse only with myself, and closely examining my nature, I will endeavor to obtain by degrees a more intimate and familiar knowledge of myself. I am a thinking ( conscious ) thing, that is, a being who doubts, affirms, denies, knows a few objects, and is ignorant of many, -- who loves, hates, wills, refuses, who imagines likewise, and perceives; for, as I before remarked, although the things which I perceive or imagine are perhaps nothing at all apart from me and in themselves, I am nevertheless assured that those modes of consciousness which I call perceptions and imaginations, in as far only as they are modes of consciousness, exist in me.</li></ol></div><div class="jsx-c09d66d3fcfb9df8 slide undefined"><h2>Descartes, Meditation 3, Paragraph 5 and 6</h2><ol start="5"><li><p>Of my thoughts some are, as it were, images of things, and to these alone properly belongs the name IDEA; as when I think represent to my mind a man, a chimera, the sky, an angel or God. Others, again, have certain other forms; as when I will, fear, affirm, or deny, I always, indeed, apprehend something as the object of my thought, but I also embrace in thought something more than the representation of the object; and of this class of thoughts some are called volitions or affections, and others judgments.</p></li><li><p>Now, with respect to ideas, if these are considered only in themselves, and are not referred to any object beyond them, they cannot, properly speaking, be false; for, whether I imagine a goat or chimera, it is not less true that I imagine the one than the other. Nor need we fear that falsity may exist in the will or affections; for, although I may desire objects that are wrong, and even that never existed, it is still true that I desire them. There thus only remain our judgments, in which we must take diligent heed that we be not deceived. But the chief and most ordinary error that arises in them consists in judging that the ideas which are in us are like or conformed to the things that are external to us; for assuredly, if we but considered the ideas themselves as certain modes of our thought (consciousness), without referring them to anything beyond, they would hardly afford any occasion of error.</p></li></ol></div><div class="jsx-c09d66d3fcfb9df8 slide undefined"><h2>Descartes, Meditation 3, Paragraph 4</h2><ol start="4"><li>...And in truth, as I have no ground for believing that Deity is deceitful, and as, indeed, I have not even considered the reasons by which the existence of a Deity of any kind is established, the ground of doubt that rests only on this supposition is very slight, and, so to speak, metaphysical. But, that I may be able wholly to remove it, I must inquire whether there is a God, as soon as an opportunity of doing so shall present itself; and if I find that there is a God, I must examine likewise whether he can be a deceiver; for, without the knowledge of these two truths, I do not see that I can ever be certain of anything.</li></ol></div><div class="jsx-c09d66d3fcfb9df8 slide undefined"><h2>Descartes, Meditation 3, Paragraph 14</h2><ol start="14"><li>Now, it is manifest by the natural light that there must at least be as much reality in the efficient and total cause as in its effect; for whence can the effect draw its reality if not from its cause ? And how could the cause communicate to it this reality unless it possessed it in itself? And hence it follows, not only that what is cannot be produced by what is not, but likewise that the more perfect,in other words, that which contains in itself more reality, cannot be the effect of the less perfect;and this is not only evidently true of those effects, whose reality is actual or formal, but likewise of ideas, whose reality is only considered as objective. Thus, for example, the stone that is not yet in existence, not only cannot now commence to be, unless it be produced by that which possesses in itself, formally or eminently, all that enters into its composition, in other words, by that which contains in itself the same properties that are in the stone, or others superior to them; and heat can only be produced in a subject that was before devoid of it, by a cause that is of an order, degree or kind, at least as perfect as heat; and so of the others. But further, even the idea of the heat, or of the stone, cannot exist in me unless it be put there by a cause that contains, at least, as much reality as I conceive existent in the heat or in the stone for although that cause may not transmit into my idea anything of its actual or formal reality, we ought not on this account to imagine that it is less real; but we ought to consider that, as every idea is a work of the mind, its nature is such as of itself to demand no other formal reality than that which it borrows from our consciousness, of which it is but a mode that is, a manner or way of thinking.</li></ol></div><div class="jsx-c09d66d3fcfb9df8 slide undefined"><h2>Descartes, Meditation 3, Paragraph 21</h2><ol start="21"><li>With reference to those ideas of corporeal things that are clear and distinct, there are some which, as appears to me, might have been taken from the idea I have of myself, as those of substance, duration, number, and the like. For when I think that a stone is a substance, or a thing capable of existing of itself, and that I am likewise a substance, although I conceive that I am a thinking and non-extended thing, and that the stone, on the contrary, is extended and unconscious,there being thus the greatest diversity between the two concepts, yet these two ideas seem to have this in common that they both represent substances. In the same way, when I think of myself as now existing, and recollect besides that I existed some time ago, and when I am conscious of various thoughts whose number I know, I then acquire the ideas of duration and number, which I can afterward transfer to as many objects as I please. With respect to the other qualities that go to make up the ideas of corporeal objects, viz, extension, figure, situation, and motion, it is true that they are not formally in me, since I am merely a thinking being; but because they are only certain modes of substance, and because I myself am a substance, it seems possible that they may be contained in me eminently.</li></ol></div><div class="jsx-c09d66d3fcfb9df8 slide undefined"><h2>Descartes, Meditation 3, Paragraph 22</h2><ol start="22"><li>There only remains, therefore, the idea of God, in which I must consider whether there is anything that cannot be supposed to originate with myself. By the name God, I understand a substance infinite, eternal, immutable, independent, all-knowing, all-powerful, and by which I myself, and every other thing that exists, if any such there be, were created. But these properties are so great and excellent, that the more attentively I consider them the less I feel persuaded that the idea I have of them owes its origin to myself alone. And thus it is absolutely necessary to conclude, from all that I have before said, that God exists.</li></ol></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"source":{"compiledSource":"var m=Object.defineProperty,c=Object.defineProperties;var f=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors;var s=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols;var n=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty,r=Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable;var h=(e,t,a)=\u003et in e?m(e,t,{enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0,value:a}):e[t]=a,o=(e,t)=\u003e{for(var a in t||(t={}))n.call(t,a)\u0026\u0026h(e,a,t[a]);if(s)for(var a of s(t))r.call(t,a)\u0026\u0026h(e,a,t[a]);return e},l=(e,t)=\u003ec(e,f(t));var d=(e,t)=\u003e{var a={};for(var i in e)n.call(e,i)\u0026\u0026t.indexOf(i)\u003c0\u0026\u0026(a[i]=e[i]);if(e!=null\u0026\u0026s)for(var i of s(e))t.indexOf(i)\u003c0\u0026\u0026r.call(e,i)\u0026\u0026(a[i]=e[i]);return a};const makeShortcode=e=\u003efunction(a){return console.warn(\"Component \"+e+\" was not imported, exported, or provided by MDXProvider as global scope\"),mdx(\"div\",o({},a))},Slide=makeShortcode(\"Slide\"),layoutProps={},MDXLayout=\"wrapper\";function MDXContent(a){var i=a,{components:e}=i,t=d(i,[\"components\"]);return mdx(MDXLayout,l(o(o({},layoutProps),t),{components:e,mdxType:\"MDXLayout\"}),mdx(Slide,{mdxType:\"Slide\"},mdx(\"h1\",null,\"Descartes, Meditation 1, Paragraph 1\"),mdx(\"ol\",null,mdx(\"li\",{parentName:\"ol\"},`SEVERAL years have now elapsed since I first became aware that I had accepted, even from\nmy youth, many false opinions for true, and that consequently what I afterward based on such\nprinciples was highly doubtful; and from that time I was convinced of the necessity of undertaking\nonce in my life to rid myself of all the opinions I had adopted, and of commencing anew the work of\nbuilding from the foundation, if I desired to establish a firm and abiding superstructure in the\nsciences.

I am a thinking ( conscious ) thing, that is, a being who doubts, affirms, denies, knows a few objects, and is ignorant of many, -- who loves, hates, wills, refuses, who imagines likewise, and perceives; for, as I before remarked, although the things which I perceive or imagine are perhaps nothing at all apart from me and in themselves, I am nevertheless assured that those modes of consciousness which I call perceptions and imaginations, in as far only as they are modes of consciousness, exist in me.\"))),mdx(Slide,{mdxType:\"Slide\"},mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Descartes, Meditation 3, Paragraph 5 and 6\"),mdx(\"ol\",o({},{start:5}),mdx(\"li\",{parentName:\"ol\"},mdx(\"p\",{parentName:\"li\"},\"Of my thoughts some are, as it were, images of things, and to these alone properly belongs the name IDEA; as when I think represent to my mind a man, a chimera, the sky, an angel or God.

Nor need we fear that falsity may exist in the will or affections; for, although I may desire objects that are wrong, and even that never existed, it is still true that I desire them. There thus only remain our judgments, in which we must take diligent heed that we be not deceived. But the chief and most ordinary error that arises in them consists in judging that the ideas which are in us are like or conformed to the things that are external to us; for assuredly, if we but considered the ideas themselves as certain modes of our thought (consciousness), without referring them to anything beyond, they would hardly afford any occasion of error.\")))),mdx(Slide,{mdxType:\"Slide\"},mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Descartes, Meditation 3, Paragraph 4\"),mdx(\"ol\",o({},{start:4}),mdx(\"li\",{parentName:\"ol\"},\"...And in truth, as I have no ground for believing that Deity is deceitful, and as, indeed, I have not even considered the reasons by which the existence of a Deity of any kind is established, the ground of doubt that rests only on this supposition is very slight, and, so to speak, metaphysical. But, that I may be able wholly to remove it, I must inquire whether there is a God, as soon as an opportunity of doing so shall present itself; and if I find that there is a God, I must examine likewise whether he can be a deceiver; for, without the knowledge of these two truths, I do not see that I can ever be certain of anything.\"))),mdx(Slide,{mdxType:\"Slide\"},mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Descartes, Meditation 3, Paragraph 14\"),mdx(\"ol\",o({},{start:14}),mdx(\"li\",{parentName:\"ol\"},\"Now, it is manifest by the natural light that there must at least be as much reality in the efficient and total cause as in its effect; for whence can the effect draw its reality if not from its cause ? And how could the cause communicate to it this reality unless it possessed it in itself? And hence it follows, not only that what is cannot be produced by what is not, but likewise that the more perfect,in other words, that which contains in itself more reality, cannot be the effect of the less perfect;and this is not only evidently true of those effects, whose reality is actual or formal, but likewise of ideas, whose reality is only considered as objective. Thus, for example, the stone that is not yet in existence, not only cannot now commence to be, unless it be produced by that which possesses in itself, formally or eminently, all that enters into its composition, in other words, by that which contains in itself the same properties that are in the stone, or others superior to them; and heat can only be produced in a subject that was before devoid of it, by a cause that is of an order, degree or kind, at least as perfect as heat; and so of the others. But further, even the idea of the heat, or of the stone, cannot exist in me unless it be put there by a cause that contains, at least, as much reality as I conceive existent in the heat or in the stone for although that cause may not transmit into my idea anything of its actual or formal reality, we ought not on this account to imagine that it is less real; but we ought to consider that, as every idea is a work of the mind, its nature is such as of itself to demand no other formal reality than that which it borrows from our consciousness, of which it is but a mode that is, a manner or way of thinking.\"))),mdx(Slide,{mdxType:\"Slide\"},mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Descartes, Meditation 3, Paragraph 21\"),mdx(\"ol\",o({},{start:21}),mdx(\"li\",{parentName:\"ol\"},\"With reference to those ideas of corporeal things that are clear and distinct, there are some which, as appears to me, might have been taken from the idea I have of myself, as those of substance, duration, number, and the like. For when I think that a stone is a substance, or a thing capable of existing of itself, and that I am likewise a substance, although I conceive that I am a thinking and non-extended thing, and that the stone, on the contrary, is extended and unconscious,there being thus the greatest diversity between the two concepts, yet these two ideas seem to have this in common that they both represent substances. In the same way, when I think of myself as now existing, and recollect besides that I existed some time ago, and when I am conscious of various thoughts whose number I know, I then acquire the ideas of duration and number, which I can afterward transfer to as many objects as I please. With respect to the other qualities that go to make up the ideas of corporeal objects, viz, extension, figure, situation, and motion, it is true that they are not formally in me, since I am merely a thinking being; but because they are only certain modes of substance, and because I myself am a substance, it seems possible that they may be contained in me eminently.\"))),mdx(Slide,{mdxType:\"Slide\"},mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Descartes, Meditation 3, Paragraph 22\"),mdx(\"ol\",o({},{start:22}),mdx(\"li\",{parentName:\"ol\"},\"There only remains, therefore, the idea of God, in which I must consider whether there is anything that cannot be supposed to originate with myself.

But these properties are so great and excellent, that the more attentively I consider them the less I feel persuaded that the idea I have of them owes its origin to myself alone.
