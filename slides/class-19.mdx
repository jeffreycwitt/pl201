## Identify the Main Conclusion

<HiddenBlock text="'Tell this to Evenus, Cebes, wish him well and bid him farewell, and tell him, if he is wise, to follow me as soon as possible (p. 98, 61b)" starterText="See p. 98, 61b"/>

or 

<HiddenBlock text="'Then Evenus will be willing, like every man wo partakes worthily of philosophy' (p. 98, 61c)."/>

or

<HiddenBlock text="Philosophers are eager for death"/>

## Look for the Immediate Supporting Reasoning 

<HiddenBlock text="'Now if this is true, it would be strange indeed if they were eager for this all their lives and then resent it when what they have wanted and practiced for a long time comes upon them' (p. 101, 64a)" starterText="Question: How is that definition used to lead to the main conclusion? (p. 101, 64a)"/>

<HiddenBlock text="Philosophy is a preparation for death." starterText="Question: Is a definition of philosophy or the 'philosopher' given? (p. 101, 64a)"/>

<HiddenBlock text="Therefore, the philosopher will be eager for it when it arrives"/>

</Slide>

<Slide key="2">

## Syllogism 1: Main argument (more formally stated)

<HiddenBlock text="1: People who prepare for death are eager for death"/>

<HiddenBlock text="2: Philosophers are people who prepare for death"/>

<HiddenBlock text="C: Philosophers are eager for death"/>

<hr/>


Question: In the current reasoning, what seems like the most critical but also most in need of support premise?

<strong><HiddenBlock text="2: Philosophers are people who prepare for death"/></strong>
</Slide>

<Slide key="3">

## Syllogism 2 (2.C)

<HiddenBlock text="2.1: The separation of the body and the soul is death" starterText="Question: What does he say death is? Does this give us an important premise? (See p. 101,  64c)"/>

<HiddenBlock text="2.2: The philosopher is preparing to separate body and soul" starterText="Question: If the Philosopher is preparing for death and we have a new definition of death, what can we say the philosopher is preparing for?"/>

<strong><HiddenBlock visibleState={true} text="2.C: Philosophers are people who prepare for death"/></strong>
<br/>

<hr/>

Question: In the above reasoning, what seems like the most critical but also most in need of support premise? 

<strong><HiddenBlock text="2.2: The philosopher is preparing to separate body and soul"/></strong>

</Slide>

<Slide key="4">

## Syllogism 3 (2.2.C)

Question: How does he try to defend this claim? (p. 101, 64d and following)
<br/>
<hr/>

<HiddenBlock text="2.2.1: The person interested in knowledge will try to separate themselves from the body (p. 101, 64d)" starterText="Question: Given this interest, how does Socrates think the person interested in knowledge will relate to the body?"/>

<HiddenBlock text="2.2.2: Philosopher is interested in knowledge (defn, assumed)" starterText="Question: In what kind of thing is it implicitly assumed that the Philosopher is interested?"/>

<strong><HiddenBlock visibleState={true} text="2.2.C The philosopher is preparing to separate body and soul"/></strong>

<br/>
<hr/>
<br/>

Question: Again, what premise seems most in need of defense here?

<strong><HiddenBlock text="2.2.1: The person interested in knowledge will try to separate themselves from the body (p. 101, 64d)"/></strong>


</Slide>
<Slide key="5">

## Syllogism 4 (2.2.1.C)

<HiddenBlock text="2.2.1.1: People who avoid obstacles to knowledge are people who [avoid the body] or try to separate the body from the soul (p. 102, 65a)" starterText="Question: Why does he think the person interested in knowledge will avoid the body?"/>
<HiddenBlock text="2.2.1.2: The person interested in knowledge will avoid obstacles to knowledge (assumed)" starterText="Given this conclusion, there seems to be a straightforward (but necessary) assumption about people who are interested in knowledge."/>
<strong><HiddenBlock visibleState={true} text="2.2.1.C That the person interested in knowledge will try to separate themselves from the body"/></strong>

<hr/>
<br/>
Question: Again, what premise seems most in need of defense here?

<strong><HiddenBlock text="2.2.1.1: People who avoid obstacles to knowledge are people who [avoid the body] or try to separate the body from the soul"/></strong>

</Slide>

<Slide key="6">

## Argument 5 (Inductive Argument)

Question: What are some of the reasons given that the body is an obstacle to knowledge? (pp. 101-103,  64d-67d)

<HiddenBlock text="1) Body offering distracting pleasures" starterText="1) see p. 101, 64d-e"/>
<HiddenBlock text="2) Bodily senses confuse and deceive" starterText="2) see p. 102, 65b"/>
<HiddenBlock text="3) Bodily senses cannot reach the real" starterText="3) more extreme version of 2; see 102, 65c-d"/>
<HiddenBlock text="4) Bodily needs take away time from the leisure activity of rational inquiry" starterText="4) see p. 103, 66b"/>
<strong><HiddenBlock visibleState={true} text="2.2.1.1.C: People who avoid obstacles to knowledge are people who [avoid the body] or try to separate the body from the soul"/></strong>

## Return to Main Conclusion 

> "Therefore, as I said at the beginning, it would be ridiculous for a man to train himself in life to live in a state as close to death as possible, and then to resent it when it comes" (p. 104, 67d-e)
