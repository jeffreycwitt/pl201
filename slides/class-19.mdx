## Identify the Main Conclusion

<HiddenBlock text="'Tell this to Evenus, Cebes, and bid him be of good cheer; say that I would have him come after me if he be a wise man, and not tarry (p. 81b, top)" starterText="See p. 81b, top"/>

or 

<HiddenBlock text="Then he, or any man who has the spirit of philosophy,
will be willing to die (p. 81b, mid)"/>

or

<HiddenBlock text="Philosophers are eager for death"/>

</Slide>
<Slide key="1">

## Look for the Immediate Supporting Reasoning 

<HiddenBlock text="It would be weird, to prepare for something, and then run away from it when it arrives" starterText="Question: How is that definition used to lead to the main conclusion? (p. 82b)"/>

<HiddenBlock text="Philosophy is a preparation for death." starterText="Question: Is a definition of philosophy or the 'philosopher' given? (p. 82b)"/>

<HiddenBlock text="Therefore, the philosopher will be eager for it when it arrives"/>

</Slide>

<Slide key="2">

## Syllogism 1: Main argument (more formally stated)

<HiddenBlock text="1: People who prepare for death are eager for death"/>

<HiddenBlock text="2: Philosophers are people who prepare for death"/>

<HiddenBlock text="C: Philosophers are eager for death"/>

<hr/>


Question: In the current reasoning, what seems like the most critical but also most in need of support premise?

<strong><HiddenBlock text="2: Philosophers are people who prepare for death"/></strong>
</Slide>

<Slide key="3">

## Syllogism 2 (2.C)

<HiddenBlock text="2.1: The separation of the body and the soul is death" starterText="Question: What does he say death is? Does this give us an important premise? (See p. 82b, bttm)"/>

<HiddenBlock text="2.2: The philosopher is preparing to separate body and soul" starterText="Question: If the Philosopher is preparing for death and we have a new definition of death, what can we say the philosopher is preparing for?"/>

<strong><HiddenBlock visibleState={true} text="2.C: Philosophers are people who prepare for death"/></strong>
<br/>

<hr/>

Question: In the above reasoning, what seems like the most critical but also most in need of support premise? 

<strong><HiddenBlock text="2.2: The philosopher is preparing to separate body and soul"/></strong>

</Slide>

<Slide>

## Syllogism 3 (2.2.C)

Question: How does he try to defend this claim? (p. 83a and following)
<br/>
<hr/>

<HiddenBlock text="2.2.1: The person interested in knowledge will try to separate themselves from the body (p. 83a)" starterText="Question: Given this interest, how does Socrates think the person interested in knowledge will relate to the body?"/>

<HiddenBlock text="2.2.2: Philosopher is interested in knowledge (defn, assumed)" starterText="Question: In what kind of thing is it implicitly assumed that the Philosopher is interested?"/>

<strong><HiddenBlock visibleState={true} text="2.2.C The philosopher is preparing to separate body and soul"/></strong>

<br/>
<hr/>
<br/>

Question: Again, what premise seems most in need of defense here?

<strong><HiddenBlock text="2.2.1: The person interested in knowledge will try to separate themselves from the body (p. 83a)"/></strong>


</Slide>
<Slide>

## Syllogism 4 (2.2.1.C)

<HiddenBlock text="2.2.1.1: People who avoid obstacles to knowledge are people who [avoid the body] or try to separate the body from the soul" starterText="Question: Why does he think the person interested in knowledge will avoid the body?"/>
<HiddenBlock text="2.2.1.2: The person interested in knowledge will avoid obstacles to knowledge (assumed)" starterText="Given this conclusion, there seems to be a straightforward (but necessary) assumption about people who are interested in knowledge."/>
<strong><HiddenBlock visibleState={true} text="2.2.1.C That the person interested in knowledge will try to separate themselves from the body"/></strong>

<hr/>
<br/>
Question: Again, what premise seems most in need of defense here?

<strong><HiddenBlock text="2.2.1.1: People who avoid obstacles to knowledge are people who [avoid the body] or try to separate the body from the soul"/></strong>

</Slide>

<Slide>

## Argument 5 (Inductive Argument)

Question: What are some of the reasons given that the body is an obstacle to knowledge? (pp. 101-103)

<HiddenBlock text="1) Body offering distracting pleasures" starterText="1) see p. 82a, top"/>
<HiddenBlock text="2) Bodily senses confuse and deceive" starterText="2) see p. 82a, bttm"/>
<HiddenBlock text="3) Bodily senses cannot reach the real" starterText="3) more extreme version of 2; see 82b"/>
<HiddenBlock text="4) Bodily needs take away time from the leisure activity of rational inquiry" starterText="4) see 84a"/>
<strong><HiddenBlock visibleState={true} text="2.2.1.1.C: People who avoid obstacles to knowledge are people who [avoid the body] or try to separate the body from the soul"/></strong>

## Return to Main Conclusion 

> "And, as I was saying at first, there would be a ridiculous contradiction in men studying to live as nearly as they can in a state of death, and yet repining when it comes upon them." (p. 84b, bottom)
