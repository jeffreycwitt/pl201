## First associations with "Ethics" and "Right Living"; an example

Imagine two different people who learned that their friend was hit by a car and was lying in the hospital. 

A: One person almost “instinctively” drops what they are doing and runs to the hospital to be by their side. Their friend says “thanks for coming”, and they respond, “no need to thank me, I would have been miserable if I weren’t by your side”.

B: Another person has had a really long day. They’ve been looking forward to watching their favorite Netflix show all day. They have just popped the popcorn and are about to sit down when the phone rings. Having just heard that their friend is in the hospital, they have little interest in going to the hospital. Everything inside of them wants to plop down on the chair and watch their show. “Their friend is probably sleeping anyway” they tell themselves. Then a voice inside them says. "It doesn’t matter what you feel, you have a duty to your friend". Acknowledging this duty, they go to the hospital. The friend says "thanks for coming", and they respond, “no need to thank me, its my duty to be here.”

Question: How do you evaluate the moral worth of these actions? 

Question: Is one superior to the other? Are they both superior in different ways? How so?

## Chapter 4 

The Tao is an empty vessel; it is used, but never filled. <br/>
Oh, unfathomable source of ten thousand things!<br/>
Blunt the sharpness,<br/>
Untangle the knot,<br/>
Soften the glare,<br/>
Merge with dust.<br/>

Oh, hidden deep but ever present!<br/>
I do not know from whence it comes.<br/>
It is the forefather of the ancestors<br/>

## Chapter 6

The valley spirit never dies.<br/>
It is the woman, primal mother.<br/>
Her gateway is the root of heaven and earth.<br/>
It is like a veil barely seen.<br/>
Use it; it will never fail.<br/>

## Chapter 8

The highest good is like water.<br/>
Water gives life to the ten thousand things and does not strive.<br/>
It flows in places people reject and so is like the Tao.<br/>

In dwelling, be close to the land.<br/>
In meditation, go deep in the heart.<br/>
In dealing with others, be gentle and kind.<br/>
In speech, be true.<br/>
In ruling, be just.<br/>
In business, be competent.<br/>
In action, watch the timing.<br/>

No fight: no blame.

## Chapter 11

Thirty spokes share the wheel's hub;<br/>
It is the center hole that makes it useful.<br/>
Shape the clay into a vessel;<br/>
It is the space within that makes it useful.<br/>
Cut doors and windows for a room;<br/>
It is the holes which make it useful.<br/>
Therefore profit comes from what is there;<br/>
Usefulness from what is not there.

## Chapter 51

All things arise from Tao.<br/>
They are nourished by Virtue.<br/>
They are formed from matter.<br/>
They are shaped by environment.<br/>
Thus the ten thousand things all respect Tao and honor Virtue.<br/>
Respect of Tao and honor of Virtue are not demanded,<br/>
But they are in the nature of things.<br/>

Therefore all things arise from Tao.<br/>
By Virtue they are nourished,<br/>
Developed, cared for,<br/>
Sheltered, comforted,<br/>
Grown, and protected.<br/>
Creating without claiming,<br/>
Doing without taking credit,<br/>
Guiding without interfering,<br/>
This is Primal Virtue.<br/>

## Chapter 29

Do you think you can conquer the universe and improve it?<br/>
I do not believe this can be done.

The universe is sacred.<br/>
You cannot improve it.<br/>
If you try to change it, you will ruin it.<br/>
If you try to hold it, you will lose it.<br/>
So sometimes things are ahead and sometimes they are behind;<br/>
Sometimes breathing is hard, sometimes it comes easily;<br/>
Sometimes there is strength and sometimes weakness;<br/>
Sometimes one is up and sometimes down.<br/>

Therefore the wise avoid extremes, excesses, and complacency.

## Chapter 40

Returning is the motion of the Tao.<br/>
Yielding is the way of the Tao.<br/>
The ten thousand things are born of being.<br/>
Being arises from non-being.<br/>

## Chapter 41 (excerpt)

The highest Virtue seems empty;<br/>
Great purity seems sullied;<br/>
A wealth of Virtue seems inadequate;<br/>
The strength of Virtue seems frail;<br/>

## Chapter 42 (excerpt)

For one gains by losing<br/>
And loses by gaining.<br/>

## Chapter 78 (excerpt)

Under heaven nothing is more soft and yielding than water.<br/>
Yet for attacking the solid and the strong, nothing is better

## Chapter 79 (excerpt)

After a bitter quarrel, some resentment must remain.<br/>
What can be done about this?<br/>
This wise keep their half of the bargain<br/>
But do not exact their due.<br/>
Virtuous people perform their part,<br/>
But those without Virtue require others to fulfill their obligations.<br/>
The Tao of heaven is impartial.<br/>
It remains with those who are good.<br/>
