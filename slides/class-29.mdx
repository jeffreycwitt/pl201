## Chapter 3

Not exalting the gifted prevents quarreling.<br/>
Not collecting treasures prevents stealing.<br/>
Not seeing desirable things prevents confusion of the heart.<br/>

The wise therefore rule by emptying hearts and stuffing bellies,<br/>
By weakening ambitions and strengthening bones.<br/>
If people lack knowledge and desire,<br/>
Then it is best not to interfere.<br/>
If nothing is done, then all will be well.

## Chapter 4 

The Tao is an empty vessel; it is used, but never filled. <br/>
Oh, unfathomable source of ten thousand things!<br/>
Blunt the sharpness,<br/>
Untangle the knot,<br/>
Soften the glare,<br/>
Merge with dust.<br/>

Oh, hidden deep but ever present!<br/>
I do not know from whence it comes.<br/>
It is the forefather of the ancestors<br/>

</Slide>

## Chapter 6

The valley spirit never dies.<br/>
It is the woman, primal mother.<br/>
Her gateway is the root of heaven and earth.<br/>
It is like a veil barely seen.<br/>
Use it; it will never fail.<br/>

</Slide>

<Slide>

## Chapter 8

The highest good is like water.<br/>
Water gives life to the ten thousand things and does not strive.<br/>
It flows in places people reject and so is like the Tao.<br/>

In dwelling, be close to the land.<br/>
In meditation, go deep in the heart.<br/>
In dealing with others, be gentle and kind.<br/>
In speech, be true.<br/>
In ruling, be just.<br/>
In business, be competent.<br/>
In action, watch the timing.<br/>

No fight: no blame.

</Slide>

## Chapter 10 (excerpt)

Can you be as a newborn babe?
Washing and cleansing the primal vision,
Can you be without stain?
Love the people and ruling the country,
Can you be without cleverness?

</Slide>

## Chapter 11

Thirty spokes share the wheel's hub;<br/>
It is the center hole that makes it useful.<br/>
Shape the clay into a vessel;<br/>
It is the space within that makes it useful.<br/>
Cut doors and windows for a room;<br/>
It is the holes which make it useful.<br/>
Therefore profit comes from what is there;<br/>
Usefulness from what is not there.
</Slide>

## Chapter 12

The five colors blind the eye.<br/>
The five tones deafen the ear.<br/>
The five flavors dull the taste.<br/>
Racing and hunting madden the mind.<br/>
Precious things lead one astray.<br/>

Therefore the wise are guided by what they feel and not by what they see.<br/>
They let go of that and choose this.

</Slide>
<Slide>

## Chapter 29

Do you think you can conquer the universe and improve it?<br/>
I do not believe this can be done.

The universe is sacred.<br/>
You cannot improve it.<br/>
If you try to change it, you will ruin it.<br/>
If you try to hold it, you will lose it.<br/>
So sometimes things are ahead and sometimes they are behind;<br/>
Sometimes breathing is hard, sometimes it comes easily;<br/>
Sometimes there is strength and sometimes weakness;<br/>
Sometimes one is up and sometimes down.<br/>

Therefore the wise avoid extremes, excesses, and complacency.

</Slide>

## Chapter 32 (Excerpt)

Once the whole is divided, the parts need names.<br/>
There are already enough names.<br/>
We need to know when to stop.<br/>
Knowing when to stop averts trouble.<br/>
Tao in the world is like a river flowing home to the sea.

</Slide>

<Slide>

## Chapter 33 

Knowing others is wisdom;<br/>
Knowing the self is enlightenment.<br/>
Mastering others requires force;<br/>
Mastering the self requires strength.<br/>

Those who know they have enough are rich.<br/>
Perseverance is a sign of will power.<br/>
Those who stay where they are endure.<br/>
To die but not to perish is to be eternally present.

</Slide>
<Slide>

## Chapter 40

Returning is the motion of the Tao.<br/>
Yielding is the way of the Tao.<br/>
The ten thousand things are born of being.<br/>
Being arises from non-being.<br/>

## Chapter 41 (excerpt)

The highest Virtue seems empty;<br/>
Great purity seems sullied;<br/>
A wealth of Virtue seems inadequate;<br/>
The strength of Virtue seems frail;<br/>

## Chapter 42 (excerpt)

For one gains by losing<br/>
And loses by gaining.<br/>

</Slide>
<Slide>

## Chapter 44 

Fame or self: which matters more?<br/>
Self or wealth: which is more precious?<br/>
Gain or loss: which causes more pain?<br/>

Those who are attached to things will suffer greatly.<br/>
Those who save will suffer heavy loss.<br/>
Those who are contented are never disappointed.<br/>
THose who know when to stop do not find themselves in trouble.<br/>
They remain forever safe.

</Slide>

<Slide>
## Chapter 46 (Excerpt)

There is no greater sin than craving,<br/>
No greater curse than discontent,<br/>
No greater misfortune than wanting something for oneself.<br/>
Therefore those who know that enough is enough will always have enough.

</Slide>

<Slide>

## Chapter 51

All things arise from Tao.<br/>
They are nourished by Virtue.<br/>
They are formed from matter.<br/>
They are shaped by environment.<br/>
Thus the ten thousand things all respect Tao and honor Virtue.<br/>
Respect of Tao and honor of Virtue are not demanded,<br/>
But they are in the nature of things.<br/>

Therefore all things arise from Tao.<br/>
By Virtue they are nourished,<br/>
Developed, cared for,<br/>
Sheltered, comforted,<br/>
Grown, and protected.<br/>
Creating without claiming,<br/>
Doing without taking credit,<br/>
Guiding without interfering,<br/>
This is Primal Virtue.<br/>

## Chapter 63 (Excerpt)

Practice non-action.<br/>
Work without doing.<br/>
Taste the tasteless.<br/>


</Slide>

<Slide>

## Chapter 78 (excerpt)

Under heaven nothing is more soft and yielding than water.<br/>
Yet for attacking the solid and the strong, nothing is better

</Slide>

<Slide>

## Chapter 79 (excerpt)

After a bitter quarrel, some resentment must remain.<br/>
What can be done about this?<br/>
This wise keep their half of the bargain<br/>
But do not exact their due.<br/>
Virtuous people perform their part,<br/>
But those without Virtue require others to fulfill their obligations.<br/>
The Tao of heaven is impartial.<br/>
It remains with those who are good.<br/>

Reinhold Niebuhr writes:

"Any justice which is only justice soon degenerates into something less than justice. It must be saved by something which is more than justice.” (Niebuhr, Moral Man and Immoral Society, p. 258)

"In so far as justice admits the claims of the self, it is something less than love. Yet it cannot exist without love and remain justice. For without the ‘grace’ of love, justice always degenerates into something less than justice.” (Niebuhr, Love and Justice: Selections from the Shorter Writings of Reinhold Niebuhr, ed. D.B. Robertson)
