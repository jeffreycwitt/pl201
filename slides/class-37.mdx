1) Question: Whatâ€™s the analogue introduced by Wellman to help us think about our duties with respect to global proverty?

<HiddenBlock text="A drowning baby at a Las Vegas pool" starterText="Consider Wellman, pages 313 and 314"/>

2) What conclusion does the author draw about our moral obligations based on this analogy?

<HiddenBlock text="Is there a moral duty to rescue this baby? (A moderate duty? see Cohen p. 327)"/>
<HiddenBlock text="Is this a morally enforceable duty (A strong duty? see Cohen p. 327 )"/>

<HiddenBlock text="Why does he think this scenario is analogous (and therefore) applicable to question of whether we have a moral obligation to give to famine relief in distant lands? (Consider the summary in Wellman, p. 316, para 2)"/>

<HiddenBlock text="3) What were your immediate reactions to this argument? Did this feel convincing?"/>

<HiddenBlock text="4) What concern does Cohen raise with the proposed analogy? (consider p. 328)"/>

<HiddenBlock text="This is a chronic condition"/>

<HiddenBlock text="5) How does the chronic condition complicate a rule or duty based approach to deciding what should be done?"/>

<HiddenBlock text="6) How does a framework that focus on the development of virtue offer avenues that might help solve the chronic condition? (Consider Cohen pp. 329-330)"/>

  <HiddenBlock text="What might be some of the causes of this chronic condition"/>
    <HiddenBlock text="How might the cultivation of certain virtues in individuals and society help resolve this chronic condition in the long run?"/>

<HiddenBlock text="Why might the cultivation of these virtues be incompatible with rescuing each child that falls in the pool?"/>

<HiddenBlock text="What are some of the tradeoffs or difficult that comes with such an approach?"/>
<HiddenBlock text="What is the right to harm?"/>
<HiddenBlock text="Why does this seem required in a Virtue Ethics System?"/>
<HiddenBlock text="Can we stomach this? How far does this right extend?"/>
<HiddenBlock text="Are there still places for intervention and enforced obligations? Can a Virtue Ethics Framework for limits on the right harm and a point when social intervention is necessary? (While not directly answer this question, consider 'Rejoinder 3' on pg. 333 as a version of this kind of concern and possible response)"/>
