# Example 1

1 The conditions under which many food animals are raised are unhealthy for humans. 2 To keep these animals alive, large quantities of drugs must be administered. 3 These drugs remain in the animals' flesh and are passed on to the humans who eat it.

# Example 2

1 There is a lot of pressure on untenured college teachers to dumb down their courses. 
2 Administrators tend to rehire teachers who bring in more money, 
and 3 teachers who dumb down their classes do precisely this. Why? 
Because 4 easier classes attract more students, and 5 more students means more money for the school.

# Example 3

1 The use of ethanol as an additive in gasoline is really a bad idea. 2 Ethanol is produced from corn, and 3 when 40 percent of the annual corn crop is burned up in car engines, that obviously raises the price of corn for food. 4 Also, adding ethanol to gasoline is highly inefficient. 5 Ethanol yields about 30 percent less energy than gasoline, and 6 its more expensive to transport and handle than gasoline.

# Problem Number 3

1 Homework stifles the thrill of learning in the mind of the student. 2 It instills an oppressive learn-or-else discipline. 3 It quenches the desire for knowledge and the love of truth. For these reasons 4 homework should never be assigned.

# Problem Number 4

1 When parents become old and destitute, the obligation of caring for them should be imposed on their children. 2 Clearly, children owe a debt to their parents. 3 Their parents brought them into the world and cared for them when they were unable to care for themselves. 4 This debt could be appropriately discharged by having grown children care for their parents.

# Problem Number 8

1 Contributions to relief organizations are often wasted. 2 Food sent to war-torn countries rarely reaches its destination, because 3 food distribution is controlled by the warring groups, and 4 these groups sell the food to buy weapons and ammunition.

# Problem Number 9

1 Research leading to the development of a scramjet engine is worthwhile. 2 Commercial aircraft incorporating such an engine could cross the Pacific in as little as two hours. 3 This would relieve the fatigue of flights from New York to Tokyo. Also, 4 such an engine could power future orbiting spacecraft.
