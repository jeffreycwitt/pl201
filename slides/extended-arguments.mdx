# Example 1

1 The conditions under which many food animals are raised are unhealthy for humans. 2 To keep these animals alive, large quantities of drugs must be administered. 3 These drugs remain in the animals' flesh and are passed on to the humans who eat it.

# Example 2

1 There is a lot of pressure on untenured college teachers to dumb down their courses. 
2 Administrators tend to rehire teachers who bring in more money, 
and 3 teachers who dumb down their classes do precisely this. Why? 
Because 4 easier classes attract more students, and 5 more students means more money for the school.

# Example 3

1 The use of ethanol as an additive in gasoline is really a bad idea. 2 Ethanol is produced from corn, and 3 when 40 percent of the annual corn crop is burned up in car engines, that obviously raises the price of corn for food. 4 Also, adding ethanol to gasoline is highly inefficient. 5 Ethanol yields about 30 percent less energy than gasoline, and 6 its more expensive to transport and handle than gasoline.


(Colin A. Carter and Henry I. Miller "Corn for Food, Not Fuel")

# Problem Number 3

1 Homework stifles the thrill of learning in the mind of the student. 2 It instills an oppressive learn-or-else discipline. 3 It quenches the desire for knowledge and the love of truth. For these reasons 4 homework should never be assigned.

# Problem Number 4

1 When parents become old and destitute, the obligation of caring for them should be imposed on their children. 2 Clearly, children owe a debt to their parents. 3 Their parents brought them into the world and cared for them when they were unable to care for themselves. 4 This debt could be appropriately discharged by having grown children care for their parents.

# Problem Number 8

1 Contributions to relief organizations are often wasted. 2 Food sent to war-torn countries rarely reaches its destination, because 3 food distribution is controlled by the warring groups, and 4 these groups sell the food to buy weapons and ammunition.

# Problem Number 9

1 Research leading to the development of a scramjet engine is worthwhile. 2 Commercial aircraft incorporating such an engine could cross the Pacific in as little as two hours. 3 This would relieve the fatigue of flights from New York to Tokyo. Also, 4 such an engine could power future orbiting spacecraft.

# Descartes, Meditation 1, Paragraph 1

1. SEVERAL years have now elapsed since I first became aware that I had accepted, even from
my youth, many false opinions for true, and that consequently what I afterward based on such
principles was highly doubtful; and from that time I was convinced of the necessity of undertaking
once in my life to rid myself of all the opinions I had adopted, and of commencing anew the work of
building from the foundation, if I desired to establish a firm and abiding superstructure in the
sciences. But as this enterprise appeared to me to be one of great magnitude, I waited until I had
attained an age so mature as to leave me no hope that at any stage of life more advanced I should
be better able to execute my design. On this account, I have delayed so long that I should
henceforth consider I was doing wrong were I still to consume in deliberation any of the time that
now remains for action. To-day, then, since I have opportunely freed my mind from all cares and
am happily disturbed by no passions], and since I am in the secure possession of leisure in a
peaceable retirement, I will at length apply myself earnestly and freely to the general overthrow of
all my former opinions.

# Descartes, Meditation 1, Paragraph 2

2. But, to this end, it will not be necessary for me to show that the whole of these are false--a point,
perhaps, which I shall never reach; but as even now my reason convinces me that I ought not the
less carefully to withhold belief from what is not entirely certain and indubitable, than from what is
manifestly false, it will be sufficient to justify the rejection of the whole if I shall find in each some
ground for doubt. Nor for this purpose will it be necessary even to deal with each belief individually,
which would be truly an endless labor; but, as the removal from below of the foundation
necessarily involves the downfall of the whole edifice, I will at once approach the criticism of the
principles on which all my former beliefs rested.

# Descartes, Meditation 1, Paragraph 3, 4, 5

Question: So, what “principle” does he begin with? What foundational principle or “basic belief” does he focus on that undergirds thousands of other beliefs.
