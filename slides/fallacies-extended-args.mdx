# Example 5

1 There is a lot of pressure on untenured college teachers to dumb down their courses. 
2 Administrators tend to rehire teachers who bring in more money, 
and 3 teachers who dumb down their classes do precisely this. Why? 
Because 4 easier classes attract more students, and 5 more students means more money for the school.
