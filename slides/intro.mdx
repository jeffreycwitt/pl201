# Syllabus Highlights

</Slide>
<Slide>

In-Class Participation (2.5%): Class involvement is a small part of your grade that typically makes a big difference. **Class involvement means, first of all, coming to class. This also means always having your course packet or course reading with you. (Not having your course materials is like coming to soccer practice without your cleats or a ball.)** Missing three or more classes will result in an automatic zero for your in-class participation grade. Missing more than 6 classes will be grounds for failing the course. Secondly, it means coming to class prepared, and preparation needs to bear fruit in the classroom. In other words, you need to strive to be an asset to the class. At times we will have opportunities for discussion; someone who is involved in class will be a thoughtful and engaged participant in that discussion. At other times, lectures will solicit your input and/or questions; an engaged student will bring up helpful and appropriate questions and be able to make a positive contribution when class input is called upon. **(Using cell phones or laptops in class, unless as an approved DSS accommodation or otherwise directed by the instructor, will result in an automatic 0 for this portion of your grade.** See "Computers and Cell Phones" policy below. Do yourself a favor and put your laptops and cell phones away and out sight for the duration of our class.)

<Slide>

Reading Quizzes/Responses (5%): Approximately once a week we will have reading quizzes and/or responses. These are low-stakes quizzes or in-class writing responses designed to motivate you too keep up with the reading and stay engaged with the course. There will be 8-12 of these quizzes throughout the semester. Because I know that everyone has busy weeks or has to miss a class, **I will drop your lowest two quizzes. (Note: Quizzes cannot be made up, but that's why I drop your lowest two quizzes. If you have to miss a class in which a quiz was given, don't worry; that will just be one of your dropped quizzes.)**

</Slide>
<Slide>

Participation Worksheets (7.5%): At various times (especially during our logic unit) you will be asked to turn in worksheets as homework before the assigned class.

</Slide>
<Slide>

Argument Analyses (15%): Two times throughout the semester you will be asked to write a short "argument analysis." This assignment is designed to help you develop the skill of tracing complicated arguments and communicating those arguments to others. Specific assignment instructions will be distributed in advance of each due date.

</Slide>
<Slide>

Mid-Term Exam 1 (20%): This exam will focus on the central problems of epistemology, basic logic, and common logical fallacies.

Mid-Term Exam 2 (20%): This exam will focus on the central problems of metaphysics. It will expect that you can articulate the basic metaphysical problems posed by the early pre-socratic thinkers and can generally explain how Plato and Aristotle responded to these problems.

Final Exam (30%): The *longer, cumulative final exam* will include short fact based questions, quotation identification, argument analysis, and essay responses on core concepts and problems discussed during the course of the semester.

Note the required exam periods now: 

Final Exam - PL201-20 (10:00am Class): Monday, Dec 16th, 1:00pm; PL201-18 (1:00am Class): Friday, Dec 13th, 9:00am; PL201-27 (2:00pm Class): Monday, Dec 16th, 9:00am;

Statement on Generative-AI: **This course focuses on skill building in the areas of close reading, argument analysis, and argument construction.** As such (and as stated in the above honor code) it is expected that in this course your compositions are self-generated. **While there are many legitimate reasons to use and value generative-AI tools, the goal of this class is to cultivate the very analytical skills that are needed to use AI tools well.** Therefore outsourcing our class exercises, just as outsourcing drills in athletics, defeats the purpose. Thus, in this class, the above Honor Code includes the expectation that your submitted responses and compositions are always self-generated.

## Reasons for a Liberal Arts Education in the Public Media

### Why This Tech CEO Keeps Hiring Humanities Majors

by Michael Litt, Fast Company, July 15, 2017, https://www.fastcompany.com/40440952/why-this-tech-ceo-keeps-hiringhumanities-majors

"My employees with humanities backgrounds regularly show they’re willing to learn new skills and try new things. Think about the other roles that deal with developing and marketing tech products and services: Sales teams need to understand human relationships. Marketing teams have to understand what gets people excited and why. Internally, our HR teams need to know how to build a community and culture so the company can continue to thrive. The nuts and bolts of software development are just one small part of any successful tech company. It would actually be foolish to limit my hiring only to people with tech backgrounds."

### That 'Useless' Liberal Arts Degree Has Become Tech's Hottest Ticket

by George Anders, Forbes, 2015, https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgeanders/2015/07/29/liberal-arts-degree-tech/?sh=74535d23745d

"In less than two years Slack Technologies has become one of the most glistening of tech's
ten-digit "unicorn" startups, boasting 1.1 million users and a private market valuation of
$2.8 billion. If you've used Slack's team-based messaging software, you know that one of
its catchiest innovations is Slackbot, a helpful little avatar that pops up periodically to
provide tips so jaunty that it seems human."

"Such creativity can't be programmed. Instead, much of it is minted by one of Slack's 180
employees, Anna Pickard, the 38-year-old editorial director. She earned a theater degree
from Britain's Manchester Metropolitan University before discovering that she hated the
constant snubs of auditions that didn't work out. After winning acclaim for her blogging,
videogame writing and cat impersonations, she found her way into tech, where she cooks
up zany replies to users who type in "I love you, Slackbot." It's her mission, Pickard
explains, "to provide users with extra bits of surprise and delight." The pay is good; the
stock options, even better."

"What kind of boss hires a thwarted actress for a business-to-business software startup?
Stewart Butterfield, Slack's 42-year-old cofounder and CEO, whose estimated doubledigit
stake in the company could be worth $300 million or more. He's the proud holder
of an undergraduate degree in philosophy from Canada's University of Victoria and a
master's degree from Cambridge in philosophy and the history of science."

"'Studying philosophy taught me two things,' says Butterfield, sitting in his office in San
Francisco's South of Market district, a neighborhood almost entirely dedicated to the cult
of coding. "I learned how to write really clearly. I learned how to follow an argument all
the way down, which is invaluable in running meetings. And when I studied the history
of science, I learned about the ways that everyone believes something is true--like the old
notion of some kind of ether in the air propagating gravitational forces--until they
realized that it wasn't true."

### Too Many MBAs?

By Ray Williams Business.com February 28, 2017, https://www.business.com/articles/liberal-arts/


"Steve Jobs made a statement that points straight to the value of the liberal arts in th 21st century. “We’re not just a tech company, even though we invent some of the highest technology products in the industry,” he said. “It’s the marriage of that plus the humanities or the liberal arts that distinguishes Apple.” Norman Augustine, longtime chairman and CEO of Lockheed Martin, insists that liberal arts deficiencies are putting the U.S. at a strategic disadvantage. In a 2010 American Management Association Study, less than 50 percent of the executives polled said their employees had effective communication and innovative-thinking skills, and 80 percent said colleges and universities could better prepare America’s future workforce by placing more emphasis on the humanities. "You need some people who are holistic thinkers and have liberal arts backgrounds and some who are deep functional experts," Laszlo Bock, Google's senior vice president who oversees the company's hiring, told the New York Times. "Building that balance is hard, but that's where you end up building great societies, great organizations."

### The Case in Defense of the Humanities
By Nian Hu, Harvard Political Review, 2017, http://harvardpolitics.com/harvard/case-defense-humanities/


"Studying the humanities in college can also give people skills that can be easily transferable to a variety of professional opportunities. “Studying the Classics has provided me with a rigorous training in close reading and analysis of texts—not to mention writing—that will serve me well in my professional life,” said Dobbs. “These skills are necessary for the jobs that most college graduates are seeking.” However, the humanities also provide individuals with skills that are perhaps less obviously practical, but equally important for ambitious students who want to make a difference in the world. According to Dobbs, the humanities 'imbue those who study it in the history, literature, and philosophy that form the basis of Western culture. What could be a more practical field of study for someone aspiring to be a leader in the Western world?'"
